        <h2>What to expect?</h2>
        <p>The programming language Python is widely used within many scientific domains nowadays and the language is readily accessible to scholars from the Humanities. Python is an excellent choice for dealing with (linguistic as well as literary) textual data, which is so typical of the Humanities. In this tutorial you will be thoroughly introduced to the language and be taught to program basic algorithmic procedures. This tutorial expects no prior experience with programming, although we hope to provide some interesting insights and skills for more advanced programmers as well. The tutorial consists of six chapters.
          <ul>
            <li>It starts with the very basics where we will try to wet your appetite. You will be asked to do many short quizes to test whether you really understand the material.</li>
            <li>The next chapter provides you with many indispensable tools that will help you to deal with the more advanced problems in the next chapters. </li>
            <li>Chapter 3 deals with preprocessing text. You will build a full-blown tokeniser and will learn how to clean up your data. </li>
            <li>Chapter 4 is a more theoretical chapter that explains to you some of the basic programming principles, common practices and where to find documentation. </li>
            <li>In chapter 5 things are becoming increasingly difficult. First, you will write a program to compute the readability of texts. Next, you will implement the basic algorithm that is behind authorship attribution!</li>
            <li>In Chapter 6 we will introduce you to the concept of Object Oriented Programming. You will implement a network structure with which you can analyze relations between people on twitter.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Installation instructions</h2>
        <p>We advice you to install a good text editor, such as <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime text 2</a>. You are of course absolutely free to use your own favourite editor.</p>

        <p>In the course we will be using software that works best with Google Chrome.  Firefox 6 (or above) and Safari will also work. Internet Explorer is not supported. </p>

        <p>We will be using Python 3 in this tutorial, so lower versions of Python are not sufficient. Below we describe the installation procedure for Python and the necessary dependencies for this tutorial.</p>

        <h3>Windows</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Download and install <a href="http://www.pyzo.org/downloads.html">pyzo</a> (use pyzo_distro-2013b.win32.exe) </li>
          <li> After (default) installation python3 resides in the folder c:\pyzo2013b </li>
          <li> Check your installation by double clicking the ipython executable. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>OS X</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>First you will need to install Xcode from the App Store. After you have successfully installed Xcode, open Xcode and go to Xcode -> preferences -> Downloads. Now click on the install button next to commandline tools. </li> 
          <li>Open spotlight and type in `terminal' to open the terminal application. (You can also go to your applications folder and then to utilities where you'll find the terminal.app)</li>
          <li>`cd' to the folder where you downloaded or saved the file mac-installer.sh (probably in ~/Downloads) by using 
          <p><pre>cd /folder/of/mac-installer.sh </pre></p>
          </li>
          <li>Run the installer with the following command. The installer will download some packages and will request for your password to install them.   <p><pre>sh mac-installer.sh</pre></p>
          </li>
          <li>To check your installation, relaunch the terminal.app. Then type in 
              <p><pre>ipython3 notebook</pre></p>
              If everything went well this should open your browser (best with Google Chrome or Firefox) on the page <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8888/">http://127.0.0.1:8888/</a> which says IP[y]: Notebook.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Open a terminal</li>
          <li>Type: 
            <p><pre>sudo apt-get install python3 ipython3 ipython3-notebook</pre></p>
          </li>
          <li>If you run another Linux distribution, similar packages should be available.</li>
        </ul>

<h2>Opening the Interactive Notebooks</h2>

<p>To open the interactive notebooks locally:</p>

<p>On Mac and Linux:</p>

<ul>
  <li>open a terminal, cd to the folder where you unzipped the python-course and run
    <p><pre>sh start-unix.sh</pre></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>On Windows with Pyzo (assuming default installation): </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Go to the folder where you unpacked the python-course</li>
    <li>Double-click start-windows.bat</li>
    <li>Make use not to use Internet Explorer, if that is your default browser, copy the URL that pops up to Google Chrome or Firefox.</li>
  </ul>
