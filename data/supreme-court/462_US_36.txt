OPINION
JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916, the last of the great Homestead Acts, provided for the settlement of homesteads on lands the surface of which was "chiefly valuable for grazing and raising forage crops" and "not susceptible of irrigation from any known source of water supply." 43 U. S. C. § 292. Congress reserved to the United States title to "all the coal and other minerals" in lands patented under the Act.  43 U. S. C. § 299. The question presented by this case is whether gravel found on lands patented under the Act is a mineral reserved to the United States.
I
A
The Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916 (SRHA), 39 Stat. 862, 43 U. S. C. § 291 et seq., permitted any person qualified to acquire land under the general homestead laws, Act of May 20, 1862, 12 Stat. 392, as amended, 43 U. S.  C. § 161 et seq., to make "a stock-raising homestead entry" on "unappropriated, unreserved public lands . . . designated by the Secretary of the Interior as 'stock-raising lands.'" 1 43 U. S. C. § 291.   The Secretary of the Interior was authorized to designate as stockraising lands only
"lands the surface of which is, in his opinion, chiefly valuable for grazing and raising forage crops, do not contain merchantable timber, are not susceptible of irrigation from any known source of water supply, and are of such character that six hundred and forty acres are reasonably required for the support of a family." 43 U. S. C. § 292.
To obtain a patent, an entryman was required to reside on the land for three years, 43 U. S. C. § 293, incorporating by reference 37 Stat. 123, ch. 153, 43 U. S. C. § 164, and "to make permanent improvements upon the land . . . tending to increase the value of the  for stock-raising purposes of   the value of not less than $ 1.25 per acre." 43 U. S. C. § 293.
Section 9 of the Act, the provision at issue in this case, stated that " entries made and patents issued . . . shall be subject to and contain a reservation to the United States of all the coal and other minerals in the lands so entered and patented, together with the right to prospect for, mine, and remove the same." 39 Stat. 864, as amended, 43 U. S. C. § 299. Section 9 further provided that " coal and other mineral deposits in such lands shall be subject to disposal by the United States in accordance with the provisions of the coal and mineral land laws in force at the time of such disposal."

On February 4, 1926, the United States conveyed a tract of land near Jeffrey City, Wyo., to respondent's predecessor-in-interest.  The land was conveyed by Patent No. 974013 issued pursuant to the SRHA.  As required by § 9 of the Act, 43 U. S. C. § 299, the patent reserved to the United States "all the coal and other minerals" in the land.
In March 1975 respondent Western Nuclear, Inc., acquired a fee interest in a portion of the land covered by the 1926 patent. Western Nuclear is a mining company that has been involved in the mining and milling of uranium ore in and around Jeffrey City since the early 1950's.  In its commercial operations Western Nuclear uses gravel for such purposes as paving and surfacing roads and shoring the shaft of its uranium mine.  In view of the expense of having gravel hauled in from other towns, the company decided that it would be economical to obtain a local source of the material, and it acquired the land in question so that it could extract gravel from an open pit on the premises.
After acquiring the land, respondent obtained from the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, a state agency, a permit authorizing it to extract gravel from the pit located on the land.  Respondent proceeded to remove some 43,000 cubic yards of gravel. It used most of this gravel for paving streets and pouring sidewalks in nearby Jeffrey City, a company town where respondent's mill and mine workers lived.
On November 3, 1975, the Wyoming State Office of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) served Western Nuclear with a notice that the extraction and removal of the gravel constituted a trespass against the United States in violation of 43 CFR § 9239.0-7 (1975), current version at 43 CFR § 9239.0-7 (1982), a  regulation promulgated by the Department of the Interior under the Materials Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 681, as amended by the Surface Resources Act of 1955, 69 Stat. 367, 30 U. S. C. §§ 601-615.  The regulation provides that " extraction, severance, injury, or removal of timber or mineral materials from public lands under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior, except when authorized by law and the regulations of the Department, is an act of trespass."
The BLM's appraisal report described the gravel deposit as follows:
"The deposit located on the property is an alluvial gravel with 6.4 acres of the 14 acre parcel mined for gravel. . . .  There are 6-12 inches of overburden on the site . . . .  It is estimated that the deposit thickness will average 10 feet or more in thickness." 85 I. D. 129, 131 (1978).
In a technical analysis accompanying the appraisal report, geologist William D. Holsheimer observed that " gravel is overlain by a soil cover of fairly well developed loamy sand, some 12-18 inches in thickness," and that " is a relatively good vegetative cover, consisting mainly of sagebrush, and an understory of various native grasses." Id., at 132. The appraisal report concluded that "the highest and best use of the property is for a mineral material (gravel) site." Id., at 131.
After a hearing, the BLM determined that Western Nuclear had committed an unintentional trespass. Using a royalty rate of 30 cent per cubic yard, the BLM ruled that Western Nuclear was liable to the United States for $ 13,000 in damages for the gravel removed from the site.  On appeal to the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA), the IBLA affirmed the ruling that Western Nuclear had committed a trespass, holding that "gravel in a valuable deposit is a mineral reserved to the United States in patents issued under the Stock-Raising Homestead Act." Id., at 139. 2
Western Nuclear then filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming, seeking review of the Board's decision pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. § 701 et seq.  The District Court affirmed the ruling that the mineral reservation in the SRHA encompasses gravel. Western Nuclear, Inc. v. Andrus, 475 F.Supp. 654 (1979). Recognizing that "the term 'mineral' does not have a closed, precise meaning," id., at 662, the District Court concluded that the Government's position is supported by the principle that public land grants are to be narrowly construed, ibid., and by "the legislative history, contemporaneous definitions, and court decisions," id ., at 663. 3
Respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. That court reversed, holding that the gravel extracted by Western Nuclear   did not constitute a mineral reserved to the United States under the SRHA.  Western Nuclear, Inc. v. Andrus, 664 F.2d 234 (1981). In reaching this conclusion, the Tenth Circuit relied heavily on a ruling made by the Secretary of the Interior prior to the enactment of the SRHA that land containing valuable deposits of gravel did not constitute "mineral land" beyond the reach of the homestead laws.  Id., at 240. The court also relied on an analogy to "ordinary rocks and stones," id., at 242, which it said cannot be reserved minerals, lest patentees be left with "only the dirt, and little or nothing more." Ibid.  The court reasoned that "if ordinary rocks are not reserved minerals, it follows that gravel, a form of fragmented rock, also is not a reserved mineral." Ibid.
In view of the importance of the case to the administration of the more than 33 million acres of land patented under the SRHA, 4 we granted certiorari.  456 U.S. 988 (1982).  We now reverse.
II
As this Court observed in a case decided before the SRHA was enacted, the word "   minerals" is "used in so many senses, dependent upon the context, that the ordinary definitions of the dictionary throw but little light upon its signification in a given case." Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Soderberg, 188 U.S. 526, 530 (1903). In the broad sense of the word, there is no doubt that gravel is a mineral, for it is plainly not animal or vegetable.  But "the scientific division of all matter into the animal, vegetable or mineral kingdom would be absurd as applied to a grant of lands, since all lands belong to the mineral kingdom." Ibid.  While it may be necessary that a substance be inorganic to qualify as a mineral under the SRHA, it cannot be sufficient.  If all lands were considered "minerals" under the SRHA, the owner of the surface estate would be left with nothing.
Although the word "minerals" in the SRHA therefore cannot be understood to include all inorganic substances, gravel would also be included under certain narrower definitions of the word.  For example, if the term "minerals" were understood in "its ordinary and common meaning  a comprehensive term including every description of stone and rock deposit, whether containing metallic or non-metallic substances," Waugh v. Thompson Land & Coal Co., 103 W. Va. 567, 571, 137 S. E. 895, 897 (1927); see, e. g., Board of County Comm'rs v. Good, 44 N. M. 495, 498, 105 P. 2d 470, 472 (1940); White v. Miller, 200 N. Y. 29, 38-39, 92 N. E. 1065, 1068 (1910),  gravel would be included.  If, however, the word "minerals" were understood to include only inorganic substances having a definite chemical composition, see, e. g., Ozark Chemical Co. v. Jones, 125 F.2d 1, 2 (CA10 1941), cert. denied, 316 U.S. 695 (1942); Lillington Stone Co. v. Maxwell, 203 N. C. 151, 152, 165 S. E. 351, 352 (1932); United States v. Aitken, 25 Philippine 7, 14 (1913), gravel would not be included.
The various definitions of the term "minerals" serve only to exclude substances that are not minerals under any common definition of that word.  Cf.  United States v. Toole, 224 F.Supp. 440 (Mont. 1963) (deposits of peat and peat moss, substances which are high in organic content, do not constitute mineral deposits for purposes of the general mining laws).  For a substance to be a mineral reserved under the SRHA, it must be not only a mineral within one or more familiar definitions of that term, as is gravel, but also the type of mineral that Congress intended to reserve to the United States in lands patented under the SRHA.  Cf.  Andrus v. Charlestone Stone Products Co., 436 U.S. 604, 611 (1978).  5
The legal understanding of the term "minerals" prevailing in 1916 does not indicate whether Congress intended the mineral reservation in the SRHA to encompass gravel. On the one hand, in Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Soderberg, supra, this Court had quoted with approval a statement in an English case that  "'everything except the mere surface, which is used for agricultural purposes; anything beyond that which is useful for any purpose whatever,   whether it is gravel, marble, fire clay, or the like, comes within the word "mineral" when there is a reservation of the mines and minerals from a grant of land.'" 188 U.S., at 536 (emphasis added), quoting Midland R. Co. v. Checkley, L. R. 4 Eq. 19, 25 (1867). Soderberg concerned the proper classification of property chiefly valuable for granite quarries under an 1864 statute which granted certain property to railroads but exempted "mineral lands." The Court held that the property fell within the exemption, concluding that "mineral lands include not merely metalliferous lands, but all such as are chiefly valuable for their deposits of a mineral character,  which are useful in the arts or valuable for purposes of manufacture." 188 U.S., at 536-537. 6
On the other hand, in 1910 the Secretary of the Interior rejected an attempt to cancel a homestead entry made on land alleged to be chiefly valuable for the gravel and sand located thereon.  Zimmerman v. Brunson, 39 L. D. 310, overruled, Layman v. Ellis, 52 L. D. 714 (1929).  Zimmerman claimed that gravel and sand found on the property could be used for building purposes and that the property therefore constituted mineral land, not homestead land.  In refusing to cancel Brunson's homestead entry, the Secretary explained that "deposits of sand and gravel occur with considerable frequency in the public domain." 39 L. D., at 312. He concluded that land containing deposits of gravel and sand useful for building purposes was not mineral land beyond the reach of the homestead laws, except in cases in which the deposits "possess a peculiar property or characteristic giving them a special value." Ibid.
Respondent errs in relying on Zimmerman as evidence that Congress could not have intended the term "minerals" to encompass gravel. Although   the legal understanding of a word prevailing at the time it is included in a statute is a relevant factor to consider in determining the meaning that the legislature ascribed to the word, we do not see how any inference can be drawn that the 64th Congress understood the term "minerals" to exclude gravel. It is most unlikely that many Members of Congress were aware of the ruling in Zimmerman , which was never tested in the courts and was not mentioned in the Reports or debates on the SRHA.  Cf.  Helvering v. New York Trust Co., 292 U.S. 455, 468 (1934). Even if Congress had been aware of Zimmerman, there would be no reason to conclude that it approved of the Secretary's ruling in that case rather than this Court's opinion in Soderberg, which adopted a broad definition of the term "mineral" and quoted with approval a statement that gravel is a mineral. 7
III
Although neither the dictionary nor the legal understanding of the term "minerals" that prevailed in 1916 sheds much light on the question before us, the purposes of the SRHA strongly support the Government's contention that the mineral reservation in the Act includes gravel. As explained below, Congress' underlying purpose in severing the surface estate from the mineral estate was to facilitate the concurrent development of both surface and subsurface resources.  While Congress expected that homesteaders would use the surface of SRHA lands for stockraising and raising crops, it sought to ensure that valuable subsurface resources would remain subject to disposition by the United States, under the general mining laws or otherwise, to persons interested in exploiting them.  It did not wish to entrust the development of subsurface resources to ranchers and farmers.  Since Congress could not have expected that stockraising and raising crops would entail the extraction of gravel deposits from the land, the congressional purpose of facilitating the concurrent development of both surface and subsurface resources is best served by construing the mineral reservation to encompass gravel.
A
The SRHA was the most important of several federal land-grant statutes enacted in the early 1900's that reserved minerals to the United States rather than classifying lands as mineral or nonmineral. Under the old system of land classification, the disposition of land owned by the United States depended upon whether it was classified as mineral land or nonmineral land, and title to the entire land was disposed of on the basis of the classification. This system of land classification encouraged particular uses of entire tracts of land depending upon their classification as mineral or nonmineral. With respect to land deemed mineral in character, the mining laws provided incentives for the discovery and exploitation of minerals, but the land could not be disposed of under the major land-grant statutes. 8 With respect to land deemed   nonmineral in character, the land-grant statutes provided incentives for parties who wished to use the land for the purposes specified in those statutes, but the land was beyond the reach of the mining laws and the incentives for exploration and development that they provided.
For a number of reasons, 9 the system of land classification came to be viewed as a poor means of ensuring the optimal development of the Nation's mineral resources, and after the turn of the century a movement arose to replace it with a system of mineral reservation. In 1906 President Theodore Roosevelt withdrew approximately 64 million acres of lands thought to contain coal from all forms of entry, citing the prevalence of land fraud and the need to dispose of coal "under conditions which would inure to the benefit of the public as a whole." 41 Cong. Rec. 2615 (1907).  Secretary of the Interior Garfield reported to the President that "the best possible method . . . is for the Government to retain the title to the coal," explaining that " a method permits the separation of the surface from the coal and the unhampered use of the surface for purposes to which it may be adapted." Report of the Secretary of the Interior 15 (1907), H. R. Doc. No. 5, 60th Cong., 1st Sess., 15 (1907).  President Roosevelt subsequently urged Congress that " to the surface of the public land . . . be separated from rights to forests upon it and to minerals beneath it, and these should be subject to separate disposal." Special Message to Congress, Jan. 22, 1909, 15 Messages and Papers of the Presidents 7266.
Over the next several years Congress responded by enacting statutes that reserved specifically identified minerals to the United States, 10 and in 1916 the shift from land classification to mineral reservation culminated with the enactment of the SRHA.  Unlike the preceding statutes containing mineral reservations, the SRHA was not limited to lands classified as mineral in character, and it did not reserve only specifically identified minerals. The SRHA applied to all lands the surface of which the Secretary of the Interior deemed to be "chiefly valuable for grazing and raising forage crops," 43 U. S. C. § 292, and reserved all the minerals in those lands to the United States.
Congress' purpose in severing the surface estate from the mineral estate was to encourage the concurrent development of both the surface and subsurface of SRHA lands.  The Act was designed to supply "a method for the joint use of the surface of the land by the entryman of the surface thereof and the person who shall acquire from the United States the right to prospect, enter, extract and remove all minerals that may underlie such lands." H. R. Rep. No. 35, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., 4, 18 (1916) (emphasis added) (hereafter H. R. Rep. No. 35). The Department of the Interior had advised Congress that the law would "induce the entry of lands in those mountainous regions where deposits of mineral are known to exist or are likely to be found," and that the mineral reservation was necessary because the issuance of "unconditional patents for these comparatively large entries under the homestead laws might withdraw immense areas from prospecting and mineral development." Letter from First Assistant Secretary of the Interior to Chairman of the House Committee on the Public Lands, Dec. 15, 1915, reprinted in H. R. Rep. No. 35, at 5.
To preserve incentives for the discovery and exploitation of minerals in SRHA lands, Congress reserved "all the coal and other minerals" to the United States and provided that "coal and other mineral deposits . . . shall be subject to disposal by the United States in accordance with the provisions of the coal and mineral land laws in force at the time of such disposal." 43 U. S. C. § 299.   The general mining laws were the most important of the "mineral land laws" in existence when the SRHA was enacted. Act of July 4, 1866, 14 Stat. 85; Act of May 10, 1872, 17 Stat. 91, current version at 30 U. S. C. § 21 et seq.  Those laws, which have remained basically unchanged through the present day, provide an incentive for individuals to locate claims to federal land containing "valuable mineral deposits." 30 U. S. C. § 22. After a claim has been located, the entryman obtains from the United States the right to exclusive possession of "all the surface included within the lines of  " and the right to extract minerals lying beneath the surface. 30 U. S. C. § 26. Congress plainly contemplated that mineral deposits on SRHA lands would be subject to location under the mining laws, 11 and the Department of  the Interior has consistently permitted prospectors to make entries under the mining laws on SRHA lands. 12
B
Since Congress intended to facilitate development of both surface and subsurface resources,   the determination of whether a particular substance is included in the surface estate or the mineral estate should be made in light of the use of the surface estate that Congress contemplated.  As the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit noted in United States v. Union Oil Co. of California, 549 F.2d 1271, 1274, cert. denied, 434 U.S. 930 (1977), " agricultural purpose indicates the nature of the grant Congress intended to provide homesteaders via the Act." 13 See Pacific Power & Light Co., 45 I. B. L. A. 127, 134 (1980)   ("When there is a dispute as to whether a particular mineral resource is included in the  reservation, it is helpful to consider the manner in which the material is extracted and used"); 1 American Law of Mining § 3.26 (1982) ("The reservation of minerals to the United   States  should . . . be construed by considering the purposes both of the grant and of the reservation in terms of the use intended").  Cf.  United States v. Isbell Construction Co., 78 I. D. 385, 390 (1971) (holding that gravel is a mineral reserved to the United States under statute authorizing the grant to States of "grazing district land") ("The reservation of minerals to the United States should be construed by considering the purpose of the grant . . . in terms of the use intended").
Congress plainly expected that the surface of SRHA lands would be used for stockraising and raising crops. This understanding is evident from the title of the Act, from the express provision limiting the Act to lands the surface of which was found by the Secretary of the Interior to be "chiefly valuable for grazing and raising forage crops" and "of such a character that six hundred and forty acres are reasonably required for the support of a family," 43 U. S. C. § 292, and from numerous other provisions in the Act.  See, e. g., 43 U. S. C. § 293 (patent can be acquired only if the entryman makes "permanent improvements upon the land entered . . . tending to increase the value of the  for stock-raising purposes of the value of not less than $ 1.25 per acre"); 43 U. S. C. § 299 (prospector liable to entryman or patentee for damages to crops caused by prospecting).
Given Congress' understanding that the surface of SRHA lands would be used for ranching and farming, we interpret the mineral reservation in the Act to include substances that are mineral in character (i. e., that are inorganic), that can be removed from the soil, that can be used for commercial purposes, and that there is no reason to suppose were intended to be included in the surface estate.  See 1 American Law of Mining, supra, § 3.26   ("A reservation of minerals should be considered to sever from the surface all mineral substances which can be taken from the soil and which have a separate value").  Cf. Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Soderberg, 188 U.S., at 536-537 ("mineral lands include not merely metalliferous lands, but all such as are chiefly valuable for their deposits of a mineral character, which are useful in the arts or valuable for purposes of manufacture"); United States v. Isbell Construction Co., supra, at 390 ("the reservation of minerals should be considered to sever from the surface all mineral substances which can be taken from the soil and have a separate value") (emphasis in original).  This interpretation of the mineral reservation best serves the congressional purpose of encouraging the concurrent development of both surface and subsurface resources, for ranching and farming do not ordinarily entail the extraction of mineral substances that can be taken from the soil and that have separate value. 14
Whatever the precise scope of  the mineral reservation may be, we are convinced that it includes gravel. Like other minerals, gravel is inorganic.  Moreover, as the Department of the Interior explained in 1929 when it overruled Zimmerman v. Brunson, 39 L. D. 310 (1910), and held that gravel deposits were subject to location under the mining laws,
" the distinguishing special characteristics of gravel are purely physical, notably, small bulk, rounded surfaces, hardness, these characteristics render gravel readily distinguishable by any one from other rock and fragments of rock and are the very characteristics or properties that long have been recognized as imparting to it utility and value in its natural state." Layman v. Ellis, 52 L. D., at 720.
Insofar as the purposes of the SRHA are concerned, it is irrelevant that gravel is not metalliferous and does not have a definite chemical composition.  What is significant is that gravel can be taken from the soil and used for commercial purposes.
Congress certainly could not have expected that homesteaders whose "experience and efforts  in the line of stock raising and farming," Letter from First Assistant Secretary of the Interior to Chairman of the House Committee on the Public Lands (Dec. 15, 1915), reprinted in H. R. Rep. No. 35, at 5, would have the interest in extracting deposits of gravel from SRHA lands that others might have.  It had been informed that " farmer-stockman is not seeking and does not desire the minerals," ibid., and it would have had no more reason to think that he would be interested in extracting gravel than that he would be interested in extracting coal. Stockraising and raising crops do not ordinarily involve the extraction of gravel from a gravel pit.
If we were to interpret the SRHA to convey gravel deposits to the farmers and stockmen who made entries under the Act, we would in effect be saying that Congress intended to make the exploitation of such deposits dependent solely upon the initiative of persons whose interests were known to lie elsewhere.  In resolving the ambiguity in the language of the SRHA, we decline to   construe that language so as to produce a result at odds with the purposes underlying the statute.  Instead, we interpret the language of the statute in a way that will further Congress' overriding objective of facilitating the concurrent development of surface and subsurface resources.  See, e. g., Mastro Plastics Corp. v. NLRB, 350 U.S. 270, 285 (1956); SEC v. C.M. Joiner Leasing Corp., 320 U.S. 344, 350-351 (1943); Griffiths v. Commissioner, 308 U.S. 355, 358 (1939).
IV
Our conclusion that gravel is a mineral for purposes of the SRHA is supported by the treatment of gravel under other federal statutes concerning minerals. Although the question has not often arisen, gravel has been treated as a mineral under two federal land-grant statutes that, like the SRHA, reserve all minerals to the United States.  In construing a statute which allotted certain Indian lands but reserved the minerals therein to the Indians, the Department of the Interior has ruled that gravel is a mineral. Dept. of Interior, Division of Public Lands, Solicitor's Opinion, M-36379 (Oct. 3, 1956).  Similarly, the Interior Board of Land Appeals has held that gravel is reserved to the United States under a statute authorizing grants to States of "grazing district land."  United States v. Isbell Construction Co., 78 I. D., at 394-396.
It is also highly pertinent that federal administrative and judicial decisions over the past half-century have consistently recognized that   gravel deposits could be located under the general mining laws until common varieties of gravel were prospectively removed from the purview of those laws by the Surface Resources Act of 1955, 69 Stat. 368, § 3, 30 U. S. C. § 611. 15 See Edwards v. Kleppe, 588 F.2d 671, 673 (CA9 1978); Charlestone Stone Products Co. v. Andrus, 553 F.2d 1209, 1214-1215 (CA9 1977), holding as to a separate mining claim rev'd, 16 436 U.S. 604   (1978); Melluzzo v. Morton, 534 F.2d 860, 862-865 (CA9 1976); Clear Gravel Enterprises, Inc. v. Keil, 505 F.2d 180, 181 (CA9 1974) (per curiam); Verrue v. United States, 457 F.2d 1202, 1203-1204 (CA9 1972); Barrows v. Hickel, 447 F.2d 80, 82-83 (CA9 1971); United States v. Schaub, 163 F.Supp. 875, 877-878 (Alaska 1958); Taking of Sand   and Gravel from Public Lands for Federal Aid Highways, 54 I. D. 294, 295-296 (1933); Layman v. Ellis, 52 L. D., at 718-721, overruling Zimmerman v. Brunson, 39 L. D. 310 (1910). 17 Cf.  United States v. Barngrover, 57 I. D. 533 (1942) (clay and silt deposits); Stephen E. Day, Jr., 50 L. D. 489 (1924) (trap rock).  While this Court has never had occasion to decide the appropriate treatment of gravel under the mining laws, the Court did note in United States v. Coleman, 390 U.S. 599, 604 (1968), that gravel deposits had "served as a basis for claims to land patents" under the mining laws   prior to the enactment of the Surface Resources Act of 1955. 18
The treatment of gravel as a mineral under the general mining laws suggests that gravel should be similarly treated under the SRHA, for Congress clearly contemplated that mineral deposits in SRHA lands would be subject to location under the mining laws, and the applicable regulations have consistently permitted such location.  Supra, at 51.  Simply as a matter of consistent interpretation of statutes concerning the same subject matter, if gravel deposits constituted "mineral deposits" that could be located under the mining laws, then presumptively gravel should constitute a "mineral" reserved to the United States under the SRHA.  If gravel were deemed to be part of the surface estate of lands patented under the SRHA, gravel deposits on SRHA lands obviously would not have been locatable, whereas gravel deposits on other lands would have been locatable.  There is no indication that Congress intended the mineral reservation in the SRHA to be narrower in scope than the mining laws.
V
Finally, the conclusion that gravel is a mineral reserved to the United States in lands patented under the SRHA is buttressed by "the established rule that   land grants are construed favorably to the Government, that nothing passes except what is conveyed in clear language, and that if there are doubts they are resolved for the Government, not against it." United States v. Union Pacific R. Co., 353 U.S. 112, 116 (1957). See Andrus v. Charlestone Stone Products Co., 436 U.S., at 617; Caldwell v. United States, 250 U.S. 14, 20-21 (1919); Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Soderberg, 188 U.S., at 534. In the present case this principle applies with particular force, because the legislative history of the SRHA reveals Congress' understanding that the mineral reservation would "limit the operation of this bill strictly to the surface of the lands." H. R. Rep. No. 35, at 18 (emphasis added).  See also 53 Cong. Rec. 1171 (1916) (the mineral reservation "would cover every kind of mineral"; " kinds of minerals are reserved") (Rep. Ferris).  In view of the purposes of the SRHA and the treatment of gravel under other federal statutes concerning minerals, we would have to turn the principle of construction in favor of the sovereign on its head to conclude that gravel is not a mineral within the meaning of the Act.

For the foregoing reasons, we hold that gravel is a mineral reserved to the United States in lands patented under the SRHA.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Reversed.

JUSTICE POWELL, with whom JUSTICE REHNQUIST, JUSTICE STEVENS, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR join, dissenting.
The Court's opinion may have a far-reaching effect on patentees of, and particularly successors in title to, the 33 million acres of land patented under the Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916 (SRHA).  The Act provides, with respect to land patented, that the United States reserves title to "all the coal and other minerals." 43 U. S. C. § 299. At issue here is whether gravel is a mineral within the meaning of the Act.  To decide this question, the Court adopts a new definition of the statutory term: " Act  substances that are mineral in character (i. e., that are inorganic), that can be removed from the soil, that can be used for commercial purposes, and that there is no reason to suppose were intended to be included in the surface estate." Ante, at 53.
This definition compounds, rather than clarifies, the ambiguity inherent   in the term "minerals." 1 It raises more questions than it answers. Under the Court's definition, it is arguable that all gravel falls within the mineral reservation. Ante, at 53-55, and n. 14, 59.  This goes beyond the Government's position that gravel deposits become reserved only when susceptible to commercial exploitation.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 18-20. 2 And what about sand, clay, and peat? 3 As I read the Court's opinion it could leave Western homesteaders with the dubious assurance that only the dirt itself could not be claimed by the Government.  It is not easy to believe that Congress intended this result.
I
In construing a congressional Act, the relevant intent of Congress is that existing at the time the statute was enacted.  See Andrus v. Charlestone Stone Products Co., 436 U.S. 604, 611, and n. 8 (1978); Winona & St. Peter R. Co. v. Barney, 113 U.S. 618, 625 (1885). The Court avoids this rule of construction by largely ignoring the stated position of the Department of the Interior before 1916 that gravel -- like sand and clay -- was not a mineral.
In 1916, when the SRHA was enacted, the Department of the Interior's rule for what it considered to be a "valuable mineral deposit" as those terms are used under the general mining laws 4 was clear: " is recognized as a mineral by the standard authorities on the subject, whether of metallic or other substances, when the same is found in the public lands in quantity and quality sufficient to render the land more valuable on account thereof than for agricultural purposes, should be treated as coming within the purview of the mining laws." Pacific Coast Marble Co. v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 25 L. D. 233, 244-245 (1897). See Letter from Commissioner Drummond to Surveyors-General, Registers, and Receivers (July 15, 1873) (reprinted in H. Copp, Mineral Lands 61, 62 (1881)).  It is important to note that the Department's test had two parts.  First, before a substance would cause the Department to characterize land as mineral, it had to be recognized as a mineral by the standard authorities on the subject.  See n. 1, supra.  Second, the mineral had to appear in sufficient quantity and quality to be commercially exploitable. 5
Under the Department of the Interior's earliest decisions, certain commonplace substances were classified as minerals. See W. H. Hooper, 1 L. D. 560, 561 (1881) (gypsum); H. P. Bennet, Jr., 3 L. D. 116, 117 (1884) (permitting placer claims for building stone).  But the Department soon began to recognize a small group of substances, that were valuable for certain purposes, as not being "minerals" "under all authorities." In Dunluce Placer Mine, 6 L. D. 761, 762 (1888), the Secretary held that a deposit of "brick clay" would not warrant classification as a valuable mineral deposit. The Secretary so held despite a finding that the land on which the deposit was found was "undoubtedly more valuable as a 'clay placer' than for any other purpose." Id., at 761.
The Department followed Dunluce in a number of subsequent cases. 6 An important case under the general mining laws for our purposes is Zimmerman v. Brunson, 39 L. D. 310 (1910). It involved sand and gravel, and was decided four years before Congress began consideration of the SRHA.  After quoting the rule in Pacific Coast Marble, the Secretary stated:
"A search of the standard American authorities has failed to disclose a single one which classifies a deposit such as claimed in this case as mineral, nor is the Department aware of any application to purchase such a deposit under the mining laws.  This, taken into consideration with the further fact that deposits of sand and gravel occur with considerable frequency in the public domain, points rather to a general understanding that such deposits, unless they possess a peculiar property or characteristic giving them a special value, were not to be regarded as mineral." 39 L. D., at 312.
The Secretary then reviewed the Department's cases on clay and stone, 7 concluding:
"From the above resume it follows that the Department, in the absence of specific legislation by Congress, will refuse to classify as mineral land containing a deposit of material not recognized by standard authorities as such, whose sole use is for general building purposes, and whose chief value is its proximity to a town or city, in contradistinction to numerous other like deposits of the same character in the public domain.  Id., at 313.
The Secretary concluded that gravel was such a material, and this clearly remained the Department's position until 1929.
The Zimmerman decision was recognized by Department officials in Litch v. Scott, 40 L. D. 467, 469 (1912),  as foreclosing "the question as to the mineral character of the land," even though "it  not appear that the  removal of the sand or gravel had any connection with the cultivation of the land and it was removed solely for the purpose of sale." And in Hughes v. Florida, 42 L. D. 401 (1913), First Assistant Secretary Andreius A. Jones wrote: "The Department does not concur with the contention that this deposit  is a mineral within the meaning of the general mining laws.  It   presents features greatly similar to the deposits of sand and gravel considered in the case of Zimmerman v. Brunson. . . ." Id., at 403-404.
Thus, it was beyond question, when the SRHA was adopted in 1916, that the Department had ruled consistently that gravel was not a mineral under the general mining laws. 8 The legislative history is silent on exactly how Congress   defined "mineral," but it is equally clear that the Department participated actively in drafting the SRHA and in advising Congress. 9 In light of this record, one must conclude that Congress intended the term "minerals" in the new statute  to have the meaning so recently and consistently given it by the Department in construing and applying the general mining laws. 10 As it was the agency authorized to    implement the SRHA, its contemporaneous construction should be persuasive as to congressional intention. This Court previously had accorded this respect to the Department of the Interior.  See, e. g., Burke v. Southern Pacific R. Co., 234 U.S. 669, 677-678 (1914); Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Soderberg, 188 U.S. 526, 534 (1903).
II
Despite the absence of "specific legislation by Congress," the Department in Layman v. Ellis, 52 L. D. 714 (1929), which did not involve SRHA lands, overruled Zimmerman 13 years after the enactment of the SRHA. 11 See 52 L. D., at 721. As a result, individuals began staking mining claims on public land containing gravel deposits to obtain land patents, not for "mineral" value, but for such purposes as fishing camps and cabin sites.  See H. R. Rep. No. 730, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 5-6 (1955).  Legislation in 1955 clarified the confusion that the Department's decisions had created. 12 Ultimately, sand and gravel were once again removed from the coverage of the general mining laws; 13 Congress reaffirmed the Zimmerman rule that common gravel is not a mineral under the general mining laws; 14 and Layman was legislatively overruled. 15
It is clear then that Congress never has, as the Court holds, considered all gravel to be a valuable mineral. 16 And I see no basis for inferring congressional intent to classify gravel, contrary to all lay   understanding, as mineral. 17
III
Congressional interest in stockraising and mineral development was subordinate to the ultimate congressional purpose of settling the West.  See H. R. Rep. No. 35, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., 14 (1916); H. R. Rep. No. 626, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., 10-11 (1914); n. 2, supra.  More than cattle and more than minerals, it was the belief of Congress that
"the Nation as a unit needs more States like, for instance, Kansas and Iowa, where each citizen is the sovereign of a portion of the soil, the owner of his home and not tenant of some (perhaps) distant landlord, a builder of schools and churches, a voluntary payer of taxes for the support of his local government." H. R. Rep. No. 626, supra, at 11 (emphasis added).
In recommending "citizen sovereignty" of the soil, 18 Congress surely did not intend to destroy that sovereignty by reserving the   commonplace substances that actually constitute much of that soil. 19
The first attempt by the Department of the Interior to acquire   ownership of gravel on SRHA lands did not occur until this case began in 1975. One would think it is now too late, after a half-century of inaction, for the Department to take action that raises serious questions as to the nature and extent of titles to lands granted under the SRHA. 20 Owners of patented land are entitled to expect fairer treatment from their Government.  In my view, the Department should be required to adhere to the clear intent of Congress at the time this legislation was adopted.  I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.
Whether gravel is a mineral within the meaning of the Stock-Raising Homestead Act of 1916 may be a matter of considerable importance in the semiarid lands of the West, but it is of much less importance to the rest of the Nation. For that reason, as well as those set forth at some length in my concurring opinion in Watt v. Alaska, 451 U.S. 259, 273 (1981), I believe the Court of Appeals should have been permitted to make the final decision upon the unique question of statutory construction presented by this case. * Accordingly, while I join JUSTICE POWELL's opinion explaining why the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed, I believe an even better disposition would have been simply to deny certiorari.
