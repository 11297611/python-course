OPINION
JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.
Respondent is a white football player of unknown political affiliation who seeks to recover damages under 42 U. S. C. § 1985(2) (1976 ed., Supp. V) for an alleged conspiracy to intimidate potential witnesses in a federal lawsuit.  Petitioners argue that the action must be dismissed because there is no claim that the conspiracy was motivated by the kind of "racial, or perhaps otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus" we held to be necessary in Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88, 102 (1971). We   reject their contention, because   the critical language in § 1985(3), the statute that applied to the Griffin conspiracy, does not apply to the violation of the first part of § 1985(2) alleged in this case.
I
The issue before us is narrow and may be briefly stated.  In both federal and state tribunals, respondent Rutledge has asserted a variety of common-law and statutory claims against Arizona State University and its officials arising out of incidents that occurred while he was a member of the University's football squad.  One of his claims is that three of the petitioners -- the Arizona State University athletic director, head football coach, and assistant football coach -- engaged in a conspiracy to intimidate and threaten various potential material witnesses in order to prevent them from testifying "freely, fully and truthfully" in his  lawsuit in federal court. 1
The District Court granted a motion to dismiss the entire complaint on the grounds that the action was barred by the Eleventh Amendment and that respondent had failed to allege a violation of his civil rights. It concluded that respondent had failed to state a § 1985 claim because he had not shown that he was a member of an identifiable class, and because his general allegations of a conspiracy were unsupported by specific facts.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A-2.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of all claims against the University and its Board of Regents and of the vicarious liability claims against petitioner Miller, remanded for further proceedings on the other state-law tort claims against petitioners, and affirmed the dismissal of all federal civil rights claims against petitioners except the one at issue here. Rutledge v. Arizona Bd. of Regents, 660 F.2d 1345 (CA9 1981). 2
The Court of Appeals construed respondent's allegations of witness intimidation, see n. 1, supra, as containing two components -- obstruction of justice at the state level, and interference with federal litigation. The former was not actionable under the second part of § 1985(2), 3 the court held, because "there exists no sufficient allegation of racial or class-based invidiously discriminatory animus." 660 F.2d, at 1355. The court acknowledged that this Court's decision in Griffin v. Breckenridge, supra, had interpreted a portion of § 1985(3) to include such a requirement in order to avoid the constitutional issues that would have attended enactment of a general federal tort law. It decided that the same principles applied to claims based on private conspiracies to obstruct justice in state-court proceedings.
But the Court of Appeals concluded that no allegations of class-based animus were required under the first part of § 1985(2), which proscribes intimidation of witnesses in the federal courts. 4 It relied on the plain language of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 and on the legislative history. Noting the Federal Government's unquestioned constitutional authority to protect the processes of its own courts, and the absence of any need to limit the first part of   § 1985(2) to avoid creating a general federal tort law, the Court of Appeals declined to impose the limitation set forth in Griffin v. Breckenridge.  660 F.2d, at 1355.
Because other Circuits have read the first part of § 1985(2) more narrowly, see Kimble v. D. J. McDuffy, Inc., 648 F.2d 340, 346-348 (CA5) (en banc), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1110 (1981); Jones v. United States, 536 F.2d 269, 271 (CA8 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1039 (1977), we granted certiorari limited to the question of statutory construction, 458 U.S. 1120 (1982). As have the Courts of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, McCord v. Bailey, 204 U. S. App. D. C. 334, 345, 636 F.2d 606, 616 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 983 (1981), and the Third Circuit, Brawer v. Horowitz, 535 F.2d 830, 840 (1976), we agree with the Ninth Circuit's analysis. 5
II
The statutory provision that is now codified as § 1985 of Title 42 of the United States Code was originally enacted as § 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13.  The length and style of § 2 of the 1871 Act, reprinted in full as an Appendix to this opinion, make it somewhat difficult to parse.  Nevertheless, if its several components are carefully identified, its meaning becomes clear.
Although § 2 contained only one long paragraph when it was originally enacted, that single paragraph outlawed five broad classes of conspiratorial activity.  In general terms, § 2 proscribed conspiracies that interfere with (a) the performance of official duties by federal officers; (b) the administration of justice in federal courts; (c) the administration of justice in state courts; (d) the private enjoyment of "equal protection of the laws" and "equal privileges and immunities under the laws"; and (e) the right to support candidates in federal elections. As now codified in § 1985, the long paragraph is divided into three subsections.  One of the five classes of prohibited conspiracy is proscribed by § 1985(1), two by § 1985(2), and two by § 1985(3).  The civil remedy for a violation of any of the subsections is found at the end of § 1985(3).  The reclassification was not intended to change the substantive meaning of the 1871 Act. 6
Three of the five broad categories, the first two and the fifth, relate to institutions and processes of the Federal Government -- federal officers, § 1985(1); federal judicial proceedings, the first portion of § 1985(2); and federal elections, the second part of § 1985(3).  The statutory provisions dealing with these categories of conspiratorial activity contain no language requiring that the conspirators act with intent to deprive their victims of the equal protection of the laws.  Nor was such language found   in the corresponding portions of § 2 of the 1871 Act.  See Appendix to this opinion. 7
The remaining two categories, however, encompass underlying activity that is not institutionally linked to federal interests and that is usually of primary state concern. The second part of § 1985(2) applies to conspiracies to obstruct the course of justice in state courts, and the first part of § 1985(3) provides a cause of action against two or more persons who "conspire or go in disguise on the highway or on the premises of another." 8 Each of these portions of the statute contains language requiring that the conspirators' actions be motivated by an intent to deprive their victims of the equal protection of the laws.
This limiting language was construed in Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88 (1971), a case in which a unanimous Court held   that § 1985(3) applies to purely private conspiracies. In explaining why that holding would not create an open-ended federal tort law applicable "to all tortious, conspiratorial interferences with the rights of others," id., at 101, we expressly stated:
"The language requiring intent to deprive of equal protection, or equal privileges and immunities, means that there must be some racial, or perhaps otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus behind the conspirators' action.  The conspiracy, in other words, must aim at a deprivation of the equal enjoyment of rights secured by the law to all." Id., at 102.
Although Griffin itself arose under the first clause of § 1985(3), petitioners argue that its reasoning should be applied to the remaining portions of § 1985 as well.  We cannot accept that argument for three reasons.  First, the scope of the Griffin opinion is carefully confined to "the portion of § 1985 (3) now before us," id., at 99;  see also id., at 102, n. 9. There is no suggestion in the opinion that its reasoning applies to any other portion of § 1985. Second, the analysis in the Griffin opinion relied heavily on the fact that the sponsors of the 1871 bill added the "equal protection" language in response to objections that the "enormous sweep of the original language" vastly extended federal authority and displaced state control over private conduct.  Id., at 99-100. That legislative background does not apply to the portions of the statute that prohibit interference with federal officers, federal courts,   or federal elections. Third, and of greatest importance, the statutory language that provides the textual basis for the "class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus" requirement simply does not appear in the portion of the statute that applies to this case.  See n. 4, supra.
Given the structure of § 2 of the 1871 Act, it is clear that Congress did not intend to impose a requirement of class-based animus on persons seeking to prove a violation of their rights under the first clause of § 1985(2). 9 The legislative history supports the conclusion we have drawn from the language of the statute.  Protection of the processes of the federal courts was an essential component of Congress' solution to disorder and anarchy in the Southern States.  Neither proponents nor opponents of the bill had any doubt that the Constitution gave Congress the power to prohibit intimidation of parties, witnesses, and jurors in federal courts. 10
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.
