OPINION
PER CURIAM.
The motion of the parties requesting the Court to decide the questions presented in the petition for writ of certiorari despite complete settlement of the underlying causes of action is denied.  See DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312 (1974).
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky with instructions to dismiss the cause as moot.
