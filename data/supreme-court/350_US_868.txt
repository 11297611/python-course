Per Curiam: A majority of the Court are of opinion that the record in this case fails to establish that a federal question is presented and for that reason the writ of certiorari is dismissed.  MR. JUSTICE REED and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS dissent.  THE CHIEF JUSTICE did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.
