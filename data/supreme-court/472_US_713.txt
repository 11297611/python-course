OPINION
JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.
Section 6331(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, 26 U. S. C. § 6331(a), provides that the Government may collect taxes of a delinquent taxpayer "by levy upon all property and rights to property . . . belonging to such person." 1 Section 6332(a) of the Code, 26 U. S. C. § 6332(a), then provides that "any person in possession of (or obligated with respect to) property or rights to property subject to levy upon which a levy has been made shall, upon demand of the Secretary, surrender such property or rights . . . to the Secretary." 2
The controversy in this case concerns two joint accounts in a bank in Arkansas. 3 The issue is whether the Internal Revenue   Service (IRS) has a right to levy on those accounts for delinquent federal income taxes owed by only one of the persons in whose names the joint accounts stand in order that the IRS may obtain provisional control over the amount in question.
I
A
The relevant facts are stipulated.  On December 10, 1979, the IRS assessed against Roy J. Reeves federal income taxes, penalties, and interest for the taxable year 1977 in the total amount of $ 3,607.45.  As a result of payments and credits, the amount owing on the assessment was reduced to $ 856.61.  App. 11.
On June 13, 1980, there were on deposit with respondent National Bank of Commerce, at Pine Bluff, Ark., the sum of $ 321.66 in a checking account and the sum of $ 1,241.60 in a savings account, each in the names of "Roy Reeves or Ruby Reeves or Neva R. Reeves." Id., at 11-12. 4 Each of the persons named, Roy Reeves, Ruby Reeves, and Neva R. Reeves, was authorized by contract with the bank to make withdrawals from each of these joint accounts.  Id., at 12.
On the same date, that is, on June 13, 1980,  a notice of levy was served on the respondent bank pursuant to § 6331(d) of the Code, 26 U. S. C. § 6331(d), demanding that the bank pay over to the United States all sums the bank owed to Roy J. Reeves up to a total of $ 1,302.56. Subsequently, there was a Partial Release of Levy for the amount in excess of $ 856.61.  On October 10, a final demand for payment was served on the bank.
The bank, contending that it did not know how much of the money on deposit belonged to Roy as opposed to Ruby and Neva, refused to comply with the levy. Ibid.  The United States thereupon instituted this action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, pursuant to § 6332(c)(1) of the Code, 26 U. S. C. § 6332(c)(1), seeking judgment against the bank in the amount of $ 856.61. 5
By way of a supplement to the stipulation of facts, it was agreed that " further evidence as to the ownership of the monies in the subject bank accounts will be submitted." Id., at 17.  As a consequence, we do not know which of the three codepositors, as a matter of state law, owned the funds in the two accounts, or in what proportion.  The facts thus come to us in very bare form. We are not confronted with any dispute as to who owns what share of the accounts.  We deal simply with two joint accounts in the names of three persons, with each of the three entitled to draw out all the money in each of the accounts.
B
The case was submitted to the District Court on cross-motions for summary judgment and on the respondent bank's motion to dismiss the complaint.  Id., at 18-24.  The District Court granted the motion to dismiss, holding the case procedurally "premature." 554 F.Supp. 110, 117 (1982). The court concluded that due process mandates "something more than the post-seizure lawsuit allowed" by the Code's levy procedures.  Id., at 114. In its view, "the minimum due process required in distraint actions against joint bank accounts," ibid ., compelled the IRS to identify the codepositors of the delinquent taxpayer and to provide them with notice and an opportunity to be heard.  Id., at 114-115. The court then outlined the procedures it believed the Constitution requires the IRS to follow when levying on a joint account. Specifically, it ruled that a bank, upon receiving a notice of levy, should freeze the assets in the account and provide the IRS with the names of the codepositors. Id., at 114. The IRS then should notify the codepositors and give them a reasonable time "in which to respond both to the government and to the bank by affidavit or other appropriate means, specifically setting out any ownership interest in the joint account which they claim and the factual and legal basis for that claim." Id., at 115. If the bank, on the basis of such information, "believes that a genuine dispute exists as to the legality of any ownership claim made by" the codepositors, "it may refuse to surrender any portion of the funds so claimed." Id., at 116. At that point, "the government may bring suit to enforce the levy on the contested funds," ibid., but it must name the codepositors as defendants along with the bank.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.  726 F.2d 1292 (1984). It expressed no opinion on the District Court's constitutional analysis.  Id., at 1293, 1300. It reached essentially the same result, however, as a matter of statutory construction.  It ruled that the IRS, when levying on a joint bank account, has the burden of proving "the actual value of the delinquent taxpayer's interest in jointly owned property." Id., at 1293. It observed that here "the rights of the various parties," id., at 1300, had not been determined.  Therefore, the Government had not shown the bank to be in possession of property or rights to property belonging to the delinquent taxpayer, Roy J. Reeves, as § 6331(a) required.
The Court of Appeals acknowledged that "Roy could have withdrawn any amount he wished from the account and used it to pay his debts, including federal income taxes. . . ." Id., at 1295. It rejected, however, the Government's contention that it stood "in Roy's shoes and could do anything Roy could do, subject to whatever duties Roy owes to Ruby or Neva," id., at 1295-1296, for it observed that "at least as to ordinary creditors,  is not the law of Arkansas." Id ., at 1296. Under state garnishment law, the court noted, a creditor of a codepositor is not "subrogated to that co-owner's power to withdraw the entire account." Instead, a creditor must join both co-owners as defendants and permit them to "show by parol or otherwise the extent of his or her interest in the account." Ibid.
The Court of Appeals then concluded that a similar precept should apply in administrative levy proceedings under the Internal Revenue Code.  It accordingly ruled that the Government could not prevail without negating or quantifying the claims that Ruby or Neva might have to the funds in question. It expressed the belief that an IRS administrative levy "is not normally intended for use as against property in which third parties have an interest" or as "against property bearing on its face the names of third parties." Id., at 1300. In such a situation, the Government was free to " suit to foreclose its lien under Section 7403," joining the codepositors as defendants.  Ibid.
Because the opinion of the Court of Appeals appeared to us to conflict, directly or in principle, with decisions of other Courts of Appeals, 6 we granted certiorari.  469 U.S. 1105 (1985).

A
Section 6321 of the Code, 26 U. S. C. § 6321, provides: "If any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount . . . shall be a lien in favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such person."   Under the succeeding § 6322, the lien generally arises when an assessment is made, and it continues until the taxpayer's liability "is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time."
The statutory language "all property and rights to property," appearing in § 6321 (and, as well, in §§ 6331(a) and, essentially, in 6332(a), see nn. 1 and 2, supra), is broad and reveals on its face that Congress meant to reach every interest in property that a taxpayer might have.  See 4 B. Bittker, Federal Taxation of Income, Estates and Gifts para. 111.5.4, p. 111-100 (1981) (Bittker).  "Stronger language could hardly have been selected to reveal a purpose to assure the collection of taxes." Glass City Bank v. United States, 326 U.S. 265, 267 (1945).
A federal tax lien, however, is not self-executing. Affirmative action by the IRS is required to enforce collection of the unpaid taxes.  The Internal Revenue Code provides two principal tools for that purpose. The first is the lien-foreclosure suit. Section 7403(a) authorizes the institution of a civil action in federal district court to enforce a lien "to subject any property,  of whatever nature, of the delinquent, or in whichhe has any right, title, or interest, to the payment of such tax." Section 7403(b) provides: "All persons having liens upon or claiming any interest in the property involved in such action shall be made parties thereto." The suit is a plenary action in which the court "shall . . . adjudicate all matters involved therein and finally determine the merits of all claims to and liens upon the property." § 7403(c).  See generally United States v. Rodgers, 461 U.S. 677, 680-682 (1983). The second tool is the collection of the unpaid tax by administrative levy. The levy is a provisional remedy and typically "does not require any judicial intervention." Id., at 682. The governing statute is § 6331(a).  See n. 1, supra.  It authorizes collection of the tax by levy which, by § 6331(b), "includes the power of distraint and seizure by any means."
In the situation where a taxpayer's property is held by another, a notice of levy upon the custodian is customarily served pursuant to § 6332(a).  This notice gives the IRS the right to all property levied upon, United States v. Eiland, 223 F.2d 118, 121 (CA4 1955), and creates a custodial relationship between the person holding the property and the IRS so that the property comes into the constructive possession of the Government.  Phelps v. United States, 421 U.S. 330, 334 (1975). If the custodian honors the levy, he is "discharged from any obligation or liability to the delinquent taxpayer with respect to such property or rights to property arising from such surrender or payment." § 6332(d).  If, on the other hand, the custodian refuses to honor a levy, he incurs liability to the Government for his refusal.  § 6332(c)(1).
The administrative levy has been aptly described as a "provisional remedy." 4 Bittker, para. 111.5.5, at 111-108.  In contrast to the lien-foreclosure suit, the levy does not determine whether the Government's rights to the seized property are superior to those of other claimants; it, however, does protect the Government against diversion or loss while such claims are being resolved.  "The underlying principle" justifying the administrative levy is "the need of the government promptly to secure its revenues." Phillips v. Commissioner, 283 U.S. 589, 596 (1931). "Indeed, one may readily acknowledge that the existence of the levy power is an essential part of our self-assessment tax system," for it "enhances voluntary compliance in the collection of taxes." G. M. Leasing Corp. v. United States, 429 U.S. 338, 350 (1977). "Among the advantages of administrative levy is that it is quick and relatively inexpensive." United States v. Rodgers, 461 U.S., at 699.
The constitutionality of the levy procedure, of course, "has long been settled." Phillips v. Commissioner, 283 U.S., at 595. See G. M. Leasing Corp. v. United States, 429 U.S., at 352, n. 18.
B
It is well established that   a bank account is a species of property "subject to levy," within the meaning of §§ 6331 and 6332.  A levy on a bank account has been permitted since the Revenue Act of 1924, § 1016, 43 Stat. 343, and the Treasury Regulations explicitly authorize such levies. Treas. Reg. § 301.6331-1(a)(1), 26 CFR § 301.6331-1(a)(1) (1984).
The courts uniformly have held that   a bank served with an IRS notice of levy "has only two defenses for a failure to comply   with the demand." United States v. Sterling National Bank & Trust Co. of New York, 494 F.2d 919, 921 (CA2 1974), and cases cited.  One defense is that the bank, in the words of § 6332(a), is neither "in possession of" nor "obligated with respect to" property or rights to property belonging to the delinquent taxpayer. The other defense, again with reference to § 6332(a), is that the taxpayer's property is "subject to a prior judicial attachment or execution." 494 F.2d, at 921. Accord, Bank of Nevada v. United States, 251 F.2d 820, 824 (CA9 1957), cert. denied, 356 U.S. 938 (1958).
There is no suggestion here that the Reeves accounts were subject to a prior judicial attachment or execution.  Nor is there any doubt that the bank was "obligated with respect to" the accounts because, as it concedes, "Roy Reeves did have a right under Arkansas law to make withdrawals from the bank accounts in question." Brief for Respondent 2.  The bank's only defense, therefore,  is that the joint accounts did not constitute "property or rights to property" of Roy J. Reeves.  See § 6331(a).
C
"' the application of a federal revenue act, state law controls in determining the nature of the legal interest which the taxpayer had in the property.'" Aquilino v. United States, 363 U.S. 509, 513 (1960), quoting Morgan v. Commissioner, 309 U.S. 78, 82 (1940).See also Sterling National Bank, 494 F.2d, at 921. This follows from the fact that the federal statute "creates no property rights but merely attaches consequences, federally defined, to rights created under state law." United States v. Bess, 357 U.S. 51, 55 (1958). And those consequences are "a matter left to federal law." United States v. Rodgers, 461 U.S., at 683. " it has been determined that state law creates sufficient interests in the  to satisfy the requirements of , state law is inoperative," and the tax consequences thenceforth are dictated by federal law.  United States v. Bess, 357 U.S., at 56-57. See also Fidelity & Deposit Co.   of Maryland v. New York City Housing Authority, 241 F.2d 142, 144 (CA2 1957); Note, Property Subject to the Federal Tax Lien, 77 Harv. L. Rev. 1485, 1486-1487 (1964).
In the Bess case, the Court held that a delinquent taxpayer, who had purchased life insurance policies, did not have "property or rights to property" in the death proceeds of the policies, but that he did have such rights in their cash surrender value.  357 U.S., at 55-56. The latter conclusion, it was said, followed from the fact that the taxpayer insured had "the right under the policy contract to compel the insurer to pay him this sum." Id., at 56. Thus, the insured's interest in the cash surrender value was subject to the federal tax lien.  The fact that "under State law the insured's property right represented by the cash surrender value is not subject to creditors' liens" was irrelevant.  Id., at 56-57. State law defined the nature of the taxpayer's interest in the property, but the state-law consequences of that definition are of no concern to the operation of the federal tax law.
As noted above, it is stipulated that Roy J. Reeves had the unqualified right to withdraw the full amounts on deposit in the joint accounts without notice to his codepositors. In any event, wholly apart from the stipulation, Roy's right of withdrawal is secured by his contract with the bank, as well as by the relevant Arkansas statutory provisions.  See Ark. Stat. Ann. §§ 67-521 and 67-552 (1980). 7 On its part, the bank was obligated to honor any withdrawal requests Roy might make, even up to the full amounts of the accounts.  The Court of Appeals thus correctly concluded that, under Arkansas law, "Roy could have withdrawn any amount he wished from the account and used it to pay his debts, including federal income taxes, and his co-owners would have had no lawful complaint against the bank." 726 F.2d, at 1295.
Roy, then, had the absolute right under state law and under his contract with the bank to compel the payment of the outstanding balancesin the two accounts.  This, it seems to us, should have been an end to the case, for we agree with the Government that such a state-law right constituted "property  rights to property . . . belonging to" Roy, within the meaning of § 6331(a).  The bank, in its turn, was "obligated with respect to" Roy's right to that property, § 6332(a), since state law required it to honor any withdrawal request he might make.  The bank had no basis for refusing to honor the levy. 8
The overwhelming majority of courts that have considered the issue have held that a delinquent taxpayer's unrestricted right to withdraw constitutes "property" or "rights to property" subject to provisional IRS levy, regardless of the facts that other claims to the funds may exist and that the question of ultimate ownership may be unresolved at the time.  See, e. g., United States v. Sterling National Bank & Trust Co. of New York, 494 F.2d, at 921-922; United States v. Citizens & Southern National Bank, 538 F.2d 1101, 1105-1107 (CA5 1976), cert. denied, 430 U.S. 945 (1977); Citizens & Peoples National Bank of Pensacola, Fla. v. United States, 570 F.2d 1279, 1282-1284 (CA5 1978); Babb v. Schmidt, 496 F.2d 957, 958-960 (CA9 1974); Bank of Nevada v. United States, 251 F.2d, at 824-826; United States v. First National Bank of Arizona, 348 F.Supp. 388, 389 (Ariz. 1970), aff'd, 458 F.2d 513 (CA9 1972); United States v. Equitable Trust Co., 49 AFTR2d para. 82-428 (Md. 1982); Sebel v. Lytton Savings & Loan Assn., 65-1 USTC para. 9343 (SD Cal. 1965); Tyson v. United States, 63-1 USTC para. 9300 (Mass. 1962); United States v. Third Nat. Bank & Trust Co., 111 F.Supp. 152, 155-156 (MD Pa. 1953). And the Eighth Circuit itself has observed that   the "unqualified contractual right to receive property is itself a property right subject to seizure by levy." St. Louis Union Trust Co. v. United States, 617 F.2d 1293, 1302 (1980). 9
Common sense dictates that   a right to withdraw qualifies as a right to property for purposes of §§ 6331 and 6332. In a levy proceeding, the IRS "'steps into the taxpayer's shoes,'" United States v. Rodgers, 461 U.S., at 691, n. 16, quoting 4 Bittker, para. 111.5.4, at 111-102; M. Saltzman, IRS Practice and Procedure para. 14.08, p. 14-32 (1981); Brief for Respondent 8.  The IRS acquires whatever rights the taxpayer himself possesses.  And in such circumstances, where, under state law, a taxpayer has the unrestricted right to withdraw funds from the account, "it is inconceivable that Congress . . . intended to prohibit the Government from levying on that which is plainly accessible to the delinquent taxpayer-depositor." United States v. First National Bank of Arizona, 348 F.Supp., at 389. Accord, United States v. Citizens & Southern National Bank, 538 F.2d, at 1107. 10 The taxpayer's right to withdraw is analogous in this sense to the IRS's right to levy on the property and secure the funds.  Both actions are similarly provisional and subject to a later claim by a codepositor that the money in fact belongs to him or her.
III
The Court of Appeals, however, applied state law beyond the point of that law's specification of the nature of the property right, and bound the IRS to certain consequences of state property law.  Because under Arkansas garnishment law, a creditor of a depositor is not subrogated to the depositor's power to withdraw the account, the court reasoned that the IRS, too, could not stand in the depositor's shoes.  This gloss, it seems to us, is contrary to the analysis and holding in United States v. Bess, 357 U.S. 51 (1958). The Court of Appeals adduced three principal justifications for its result.  The first was its belief that under Arkansas law Roy did not have a sufficient property interest in the funds to support the levy. The second was its concern that Ruby and Neva might possess competing claims to the funds on deposit, and that the bank might be subject to claims asserted by them.  The third was its stated conclusion that "levy is not normally intended for use as against property . . . bearing on its face the names of third parties, and in which those third parties likely have a property interest." 726 F.2d, at 1300.
We are not persuaded by any of these asserted justifications.
The Court of Appeals' conclusion that Roy did not possess "property  rights to property" on which the IRS could levy rested heavily on its understanding of the Arkansas law of creditors' rights, particularly those in garnishment.  Id., at 1295-1296.See Hayden v. Gardner, 238 Ark. 351, 381 S. W. 2d 752 (1964). As we have suggested, this misconceives the role properly played by state law in federal tax-collection matters. The question whether a state-law right constitutes "property" or "rights to property" is a matter of federal law.  United States v. Bess, 357 U.S., at 56-57 . Thus, the facts that under Arkansas law Roy's creditors, unlike Roy himself, could not exercise his right of withdrawal in their favor and in a garnishment proceeding would have to join his codepositors are irrelevant.  The federal statute relates to the taxpayer's rights to property and not to his creditors' rights.  The Court of Appeals would remit the IRS to the rights only an ordinary creditor would have under state law. That result " the government to a class of creditors to which it is superior." Randall v. H. Nakashima & Co., 542 F.2d 270, 274, n. 8 (CA5 1976).
The Court of Appeals also was concerned that Ruby and Neva might have rights that are affected if the levy were honored.  726 F.2d, at 1297-1300.This reasoning, however, runs counter to the observation above that a bank served with a notice of levy has two, and only two, possible defenses for failure to comply with the demand: that it is not in possession of property of the taxpayer, or that the property is subject to a prior judicial attachment or execution. As we have stated, neither defense is applicable here.  That another party or parties may have competing claims to the accounts is not a legitimate statutory defense.
In its understandable concern for Ruby's and Neva's property interests, the Court of Appeals has ignored the statutory scheme established by Congress to protect those rights.  Crucially, the administrative levy, as has been noted, is only a provisional remedy. "The final judgment in  action settles no rights in the property subject to seizure." United States v. New England Merchants National Bank, 465 F.Supp. 83, 87 (Mass. 1979).Other claimants, if they have rights, may assert them. Congress recognized this when the Code's summary-collection procedures were enacted, S. Rep. No. 1708, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 29 (1966), and when it provided in § 7426 of the Code, 26 U. S. C. § 7426, that one claiming an interest in property seized for another's taxes may bring a civil action against the United States to have the property or the proceeds of its sale returned. 11 Congress also has provided, by § 6343(b), an effective and inexpensive administrative remedy for the return of the property.  See Treas. Reg. § 301.6343-1(b)(2), 26 CFR § 301.6343-1(b)(2) (1984). 12
Congress thus balanced the interest of the Government in the speedy collection of taxes against the interests of any claimants to the property, and reconciled those interests by permitting the IRS to levy on the assets at once, leaving ownership disputes to be resolved in a postseizure administrative or judicial proceeding.  See United Sand & Gravel Contractors, Inc. v. United States, 624 F.2d 733, 739 (CA5 1980); Valley Finance, Inc. v. United   States, 203 U. S. App. D. C. 128, 136-137, 629 F.2d 162, 170-171 (1980), cert. denied sub nom. Pacific Development, Inc. v. United States, 451 U.S. 1018 (1981). Its decision that certain property rights must yield provisionally to governmental need should not have been disregarded by the Court of Appeals.  Nor would the bank be exposed to double liability were it to honor the IRS levy. The Code provides administrative and judicial remedies for codepositors against the Government, and any attempt to secure payment in this situation from the bank itself would be contrary to the federal enforcement scheme. 13
The Court of Appeals' final justification for its holding was its belief that an IRS levy "is not normally intended for use as against property in which third parties have an interest" or "as against property bearing on its face the names of third parties, and in which those third parties likely have a property interest." 726 F.2d, at 1300. The court acknowledged the existence of § 7426 but felt that that statute was designed to protect only those third parties "whose property has been seized 'inadvertently.'" 726 F.2d, at 1300.
We disagree.  The IRS's understanding of the terms of the Code is entitled to considerable deference.  Here, moreover, collection provisions plainly contemplate that a taxpayer's interest in property may be less than full ownership.   The tax lien attaches not only to "property" but also to "rights to property." See S. Rep. No. 1708, at 29. Further, we see nothing in the language of § 7426 that distinguishes among various species of third-party claimants.  The language of the statute encompasses advertent seizures as well as inadvertent ones. 14 There is nothing express or    implied in United States v. Rodgers, 461 U.S. 677 (1983), to the contrary.
Rodgers held that § 7403 empowers a district court to order the sale of a family house in which a delinquent taxpayer has an interest,   even though a nondelinquent spouse also has a homestead interest in the house under state law. 461 U.S., at 698-700. In so ruling, the Court contrasted the operation of § 7403 with that of § 6331.  See 461 U.S., at 696 .The Court noted that   § 6331, unlike § 7403, does not "implicate the rights of third parties," because an administrative levy, unlike a judicial lien-foreclosure action, does not determine the ownership rights to the property.  Instead, third parties whose property is seized in an administrative levy "are entitled to claim that the property has been 'wrongfully levied upon,' and may apply for its return either through administrative channels . . . or through a civil action." Ibid.  The Court, in other words, recognized what we now make explicit: that § 6331 is a provisional remedy, which does not determine the rights of third parties until after the levy is made, in postseizure administrative or judicial hearings. 15
The Court of Appeals' result would force the IRS, if it wished to pursue a delinquent taxpayer's interest in a joint bank account, to institute a lien-foreclosure suit under § 7403, joining all codepositors as defendants.  The practical effect of this would be to eliminate the alternative procedure for administrative levy under §§ 6331 and 6332.  We do not lightly discard this alternative relief that Congress so clearly has provided for the Government.  If the IRS were required to bring a lien-foreclosure suit each time it wished to execute a tax lien on funds in a joint bank account, it would be uneconomical, as a practical matter, to do so on small sums of money such as those at issue here.  And it would be easy for a delinquent taxpayer to evade, or at least defer, his obligations by placing his funds in joint bank accounts.  While one might not be enthusiastic about paying taxes, it is still true that "taxes are the life-blood of government, and their prompt and certain availability an imperious need." Bull v. United States, 295 U.S. 247, 259 (1935).
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
It is so ordered.

DISSENT BY: POWELL
JUSTICE POWELL, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE STEVENS join, dissenting.
The issue presented is whether the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may lawfully seize a joint bank account for payment of a single codepositor's delinquent taxes when it does not know how much, if any, of the account belongs to the delinquent. As it seems to me that the Court today misreads the relevant statutory language, in effect overrules prior decisions of this Court, and substantially ignores the property rights of nondelinquent taxpayers, I dissent.
I
The parties have stipulated the following facts.  On June 13, 1980, respondent bank held $ 321.66 in a checking account and $ 1,241.60 in a savings account, each in the names of "Roy Reeves or Ruby Reeves or Neva R. Reeves." App. 11-12. Under state law and by contract with the bank, each of these individuals could withdraw any amount from either account.  Also on June 13, the IRS served a notice of levy on the bank demanding that it pay over all sums owed to Roy J. Reeves up to $ 1,302.56, the balance of a tax assessment against him. It later issued a partial release of levy for moneys in excess of $ 856.61 and served a final demand for payment on the bank.  The bank, however, refused to pay over this amount because it did not know how much of the money in the accounts belonged to Roy Reeves as opposed to Ruby and Neva.  The Government, to enforce its levy, then sued the bank for $ 856.61.  Before the District Court the parties agreed to submit " further evidence as to the ownership of the monies in the subject bank accounts . . . ." App. 17.  As a result, neither the Government nor the Court knows how much of the funds in each account was owned by each codepositor.
The District Court dismissed the complaint as "premature." 554 F.Supp. 110, 117 (ED Ark. 1982). It held that "the interest of  co-depositor in not having his ownership interest in the account erroneously taken by the government . . .  some notice procedure at the levy stage . . . ." Id., at 114. Due process, it found, required the IRS to give codepositors notice of the levy action before seizing the accounts.  Id., at 114-115. The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed without expressing any opinion on the District Court's due process analysis.  726 F.2d 1292 (1984). Instead, it reached a similar result as a matter of statutory construction.  In particular, it held that the Government had not shown the bank to be in possession of property or rights to property belonging to the tax delinquent, as the levy statute requires.

Because "taxes are the life-blood of government, and their prompt and certain availability an imperious need," Bull v. United States, 295 U.S. 247, 259 (1935), Congress has created a "formidable arsenal of collection tools . . . ," United States v. Rodgers, 461 U.S. 677, 683 (1983). Central to this "arsenal" are administrative levy, 26 U. S. C. § 6331, and judicial foreclosure, § 7403, two procedures by which the Government can seize and sell property in which the delinquent taxpayer has an interest.  Each procedure is designed to apply to specific kinds of situations to ensure that taxes owed are paid while respecting the rights of nondelinquents who may have an interest in the property.
The Court today, however, ignores the property rights of nondelinquents.  It holds that a delinquent's right to compel payment from a bank of balances in a joint account entitles the Government to levy on all of those funds -- even when it is stipulated, as in this case, that the Government does not know that any of the money in the account actually belongs to the delinquent. By so holding, the Court disregards both the plain language and structure of the statute, ignores this Court's century-long interpretation of the Code (effectively overruling Mansfield v. Excelsior Refining Co., 135 U.S. 326 (1890), and part of United States v. Bess, 357 U.S. 51 (1958)), and disregards the fact that under Arkansas law a codepositor may have no property interest in funds that he may withdraw from the joint account.
III
Administrative levy under 26 U. S. C. § 6331 is the more drastic of the Government's two primary collection procedures. 1 See Bull v. United States, supra, at 259-260. By allowing the Government summarily to seize and sell "all property and rights to property . . . belonging to ," 26 U. S. C. § 6331(a), administrative levy permits the IRS to collect unpaid taxes without judicial intervention. It is a "summary, non-judicial process, a method of self-help authorized by statute which provides the Commissioner with a prompt and convenient method for satisfying delinquent tax claims." United States v. Sullivan, 333 F.2d 100, 116 (CA3 1964). It provides no notice to third parties that property in which they may have an interest has been seized. If an individual discovers a levy and believes that it was wrongful, his or her only recourse is to seek administrative review under 26 U. S. C. § 6343(b) within nine months 2 or file suit in federal district court under 26 U. S. C. § 7426(a)(1) within the same amount of time. 3
Section 7403 provides a quite different method for collecting delinquent taxes. 4 Under § 7403, the Attorney General, at the request of the Secretary of the Treasury, institutes a civil action in federal district court "to subject any property . . . in which  has any right, title, or interest, to the payment of such tax." 26 U. S. C. § 7403(a).  All persons "claiming any interest in the property" must be joined as parties, § 7403(b), and "duly notified of the action," § 7403(c).  Unlike a § 6331 levy, a § 7403 suit is a plenary action in which the court " all matters involved" and "finally  the merits of all claims to and liens upon the property." § 7403(c).  The district court may decree the sale of the property and distribution of the proceeds "according to the findings of the court in respect to the interests of the parties and of the United States." Ibid .
The language of these two provisions reveals the central difference between them.  While § 6331 applies to "property and rights to property . . . belonging to ," § 6331(a), § 7403 applies to "property . . . in which  has any right, title, or interest . . . ," § 7403(a).  In other words, § 6331 permits seizure and sale of property or property rights belonging to the delinquent, while § 7403 allows the Government to seize and sell any property right in which the delinquent has an interest -- even a partial interest.  In many cases, of course, this difference is unimportant.  Both procedures, for example, apply to any property interest that belongs completely to the delinquent, for it is necessarily true that any right to property "belonging to" the delinquent is also property in which he "has  . . . interest." In general, however, the opposite is not always true.  A property right in which the delinquent has only a partial interest does not " to" the delinquent and hence is not susceptible to levy.
Until today, this Court has followed this interpretation of the levy and foreclosure provisions for the past century.  In Mansfield v. Excelsior Refining Co., 135 U.S. 326 (1890), the Court held that the Government could not levy on property rights in which a delinquent had less than a complete interest.  In that case, the Government had levied on the fee interest in property that the delinquent had leased for a term of years.  One issue presented was whether the Government's subsequent sale of the property conveyed the freehold or only the leasehold interest.  The first Justice Harlan analyzed the issue as follows:
"The government neglected to pursue the only mode by which the fee could be sold; namely, a suit in equity, in which all persons interested in the property could have been made parties.  When the  was in default in respect to taxes, it was for the proper officers of the government to elect whether they would seek satisfaction of its demands by means of a seizure and sale by the collector of the  interest only, or by a suit to which all persons having claims upon the premises on which the government had a lien should be made parties.  They chose to adopt the former method, under which only the interest of the delinquent . . . could be seized and sold." Id., at 341.
In other words, the Government could have either levied administratively only on the leasehold or proceeded in equity (the forerunner of § 7403) to condemn the entire freehold interest.  Under the former approach, it could take only the interest that completely " to" the delinquent, while   under the latter, it could take property interests of which the delinquent owned only a part. 5 Accord, Blacklock v. United States, 208 U.S. 75 (1908).
In United States v. Rodgers, 461 U.S. 677 (1983), we recently reaffirmed this understanding of the statutory scheme.  After noting that § 7403 exhibits " solicitude for third parties," id., at 695, we discussed how §§ 6331 and 7403 differ:
"Under . . . § 6331(a), the Government may sell for the collection of unpaid taxes all nonexempt 'property and rights to property . . . belonging to  . . . .' Section 6331, unlike § 7403, does not require notice and hearing for third parties, because no rights of third parties are intended to be implicated by § 6331.  Indeed, third parties whose property or interests in property have been seized inadvertently are entitled to claim that the property has been 'wrongfully levied upon,' and may apply for its return either through administrative channels . . . or through a civil action filed in a federal district court. . . .  In the absence of such 'wrongful levy,' the entire proceeds of a sale conducted pursuant to administrative levy may be applied, without any prior distribution of the sort required by § 7403, to the expenses of the levy and sale, the specific tax liability on the seized property, and the general tax liability of the delinquent taxpayer." Id., at 696 (first emphasis in original, second added).
The Court later described the various advantages of each method of tax collection as follows:
"Among the advantages of administrative levy is that it is quick and relatively inexpensive.  Among the advantages of a § 7403 proceeding is that it gives the Federal Government the opportunity to seek the highest return possible on the forced sale of property interests liable for the payment of federal taxes.  The provisions of § 7403 are broad and profound.  Nevertheless, § 7403 is punctilious in protecting the vested rights of third parties caught in the Government's collection effort, and in ensuring that the Government not receive out of the proceeds of the sale any more than that to which it is properly entitled." Id., at 699 (emphasis added). 6
As Mansfield and Rodgers make clear, this Court long has interpreted "property and rights to property belonging to the delinquent" to mean exactly that.  Section 6331's reach extends only to property rights completely belonging to the delinquent.
IV
The narrow question presented, then, is whether the Government levied upon property or rights to property belonging only to Roy Reeves.  The Court holds that the Government did so because it levied on Roy Reeves' right under state law to require the bank to pay over to him the outstanding balances in the accounts.  This right unquestionably belonged to Roy Reeves, as it did to each of the other codepositors. They all had the same right to withdraw. But the right to withdraw funds was no more than that.  It was a right accorded parties to joint accounts as a matter of mutual convenience, and it was independent of any right to or in the property.  It encompassed no right of possession, use, or ownership over the funds when withdrawn.  See Black v. Black, 199 Ark. 609, 617, 135 S. W. 2d 837, 841 (1940); Hayse v. Hayse, 4 Ark. App. 160-B, 160-F, 630 S. W. 2d 48, 49-50 (1982). These property rights, which the levy provides no way of determining, are defined by independent principles of Arkansas law that are not now at issue. 7
The Government, however, is not levying on the mere right to withdraw, which is of little value without any right of ownership. The levy at issue reaches the underlying funds in the accounts -- no matter whom they belong to.  Roy Reeves could, as the Court argues, have withdrawn all the joint funds, but, if under state law he had no independent right in the property itself, he could not legally possess the funds of the others, let alone use them to pay his taxes.  That the delinquent might unlawfully convert the money of others to pay his taxes does not give the Government the right to do so.  The Government cannot "'" into the taxpayer's shoes,"'" ante, at 725, quoting United States v. Rodgers, 461 U.S., at 691, n. 16, in this sense.  It hardly comports with the " sense" the Court relies on, ante, at 725, to hold that the Government may seize and sell property belonging only to third parties to pay taxes owed by the delinquent. 8
The Court nevertheless holds that the right to withdraw all of a joint account is determinative because "'it is inconceivable that Congress . . . intended to prohibit the Government from levying on that which is plainly accessible to the delinquent taxpayer-depositor.'" 9 Ante, at   726, quoting United States v. First National Bank of Arizona , 348 F.Supp. 388, 389 (Ariz. 1970) (emphasis added), aff'd, 458 F.2d 513 (CA9 1972) (per curiam).  By holding that mere accessibility controls, the Court simply ignores the plain language of § 6331.  It also effectively overrides state law that "'controls in determining the nature of the legal interest which the taxpayer  in the property.'" 10 Aquilino v. United States, 363 U.S. 509, 513 (1960), quoting Morgan v. Commissioner, 309 U.S. 78, 82 (1940) ; United States v. Bess, 357 U.S., at 55. Under the Court's reasoning, for example, a codepositor's right to withdraw would allow the Government to levy on a joint account even if the Government knew that under state law none of the funds in the joint account "belonged to" the delinquent codepositor, i. e., the delinquent had no property interest in the funds themselves.  11 Cf.  Aquilino v. United States, supra, at 513, n. 3 ("It would indeed be anomalous to say that the taxpayer's 'property and rights to property' included property in which, under the relevant state law, he had no property interest at all").  Such a position exceeds even the IRS's own interpretation of its levy powers.  Rev. Ruling 55-187, 1955-1 Cum. Bull. 197 ("A joint checking account is subject to levy only to the extent of a taxpayer's interest therein, which will be determined from the facts in each case").  This position, moreover, effectively overrules not only Mansfield but also part of United States v. Bess, supra, a case in which this Court held that a delinquent could have no "property or right to property" in funds over which he had no right of possession.  357 U.S., at 55-56.
The Court also disregards the statutory language and its prior cases when it argues that the levy authorized by § 6331 is only a "provisional" remedy.  Ante, at 715, 720, 726, and 728.  Third parties who have their property taken may pursue -- if they know about the taking -- either administrative or judicial relief.  But one would hardly characterize as "provisional" the Government's taking of an innocent party's property without notice, especially when, even if the taking is discovered, the burden is then on the innocent party to institute recovery proceedings. 12 Furthermore, absent notice of any kind, the nine months that the administrative, 26 U. S. C. § 6343(b), and judicial, 26 U. S. C. § 6532(c)(1), remedies ordinarily give third parties to contest a levy is a short time indeed.  There is no certainty that within this time they will discover that their property has been used to pay someone else's taxes.  This may be particularly true as to the owners of joint savings accounts, owners in common of unimproved real estate, and owners in other situations where there may be little occasion to know that one's property has been seized by an IRS levy. In short, the Court's decision often will place the property rights of third parties in serious jeopardy. 13
V
On the stipulated facts, the IRS did not know what portion, if any, of the joint accounts levied upon " to" Roy Reeves.  It knew only that he had a right to withdraw that under state law encompassed no right to the possession, use, or ownership of the funds when withdrawn.  In allowing the levy under these circumstances, the Court today not only decides this case contrary to all of the relevant decisions of the Courts of Appeals but also effectively overrules sub silentio its own prior decisions.  Moreover, the Court relies on remedies that, because no notice is provided, may in many cases prove ineffective in protecting the rights of third parties. 14
I accordingly dissent, and would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
