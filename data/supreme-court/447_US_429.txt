OPINION
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.
The issue in this case is whether, consistent with the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const., Art. I, ยง 8, cl. 3, the State of South Dakota, in a time of shortage, may confine the sale of the cement it produces solely to its residents.
I
In 1919, South Dakota undertook plans to build a cement plant. The project, a product of the State's then prevailing Progressive political movement, was initiated in response to recent regional cement shortages that "interfered with and delayed both public and private enterprises," and that were "threatening the people of this state." Eakin v. South Dakota State Cement Comm'n, 44 S. D. 268, 272, 183 N. W. 651, 652 (1921). 1 In 1920, the South Dakota   Cement Commission anticipated " there would be a ready market for the entire output of the plant within the state." Report of State Cement Commission 9 (1920).  The plant, however, located at Rapid City, soon produced more cement than South Dakotans could use.  Over the years, buyers in no less than nine nearby States purchased cement from the State's plant. App. 26.  Between 1970 and 1977, some 40% of the plant's output went outside the State.
The plant's list of out-of-state cement buyers included petitioner Reeves, Inc. Reeves is a ready-mix concrete 2 distributor organized under Wyoming law and with facilities in Buffalo, Gillette, and Sheridan, Wyo.  Id., at 15.  From the beginning of its operations in 1958, and until 1978, Reeves purchased about 95% of its cement from the South Dakota plant. Id., at 15 and 22.  In 1977, its purchases were $ 1,172,000.  Id., at 17.  In turn, Reeves has supplied three northwestern Wyoming counties with more than half their ready-mix concrete needs.  Id., at 15.  For 20 years the relationship between Reeves and the South Dakota cement plant was amicable, uninterrupted, and mutually profitable.
As the 1978 construction season approached, difficulties at the plant slowed production.  Meanwhile, a booming construction industry spurred demand for cement both regionally and nationally.  Id., at 13.  The plant found itself unable to meet all orders.  Faced with the same type of "serious cement shortage" that inspired the plant's construction, the Commission "reaffirmed its policy of supplying all South Dakota customers first and to honor all contract commitments, with the remaining volume allocated on a first come, first served basis." Ibid. 3
Reeves, which had no pre-existing long-term supply contract, was hit hard and quickly by this development.  On June 30, 1978, the plant informed Reeves that it could not continue to fill Reeves' orders, and on July 5, it turned away a Reeves truck.  Id., at 17-18.  Unable to find another supplier, id., at 21, Reeves was forced to cut production by 76% in mid-July.  Id., at 20.
On July 19, Reeves brought this suit against the Commission, challenging the plant's policy of preferring South Dakota buyers, and seeking injunctive relief. Id., at 3-10.  After conducting a hearing and receiving briefs and affidavits, the District Court found no substantial issue of material fact and permanently enjoined the Commission's practice.  The court reasoned that South Dakota's "hoarding" was inimical to the national free market envisioned by the Commerce Clause. Id., at 27-30.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed.  Reeves, Inc. v. Kelley, 586 F.2d 1230, 1232 (1978).It concluded that the State had "simply acted in a proprietary capacity," as permitted by Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U.S. 794 (1976). Petitioner sought certiorari. This Court granted the petition, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case for further consideration in light of Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U.S. 322 (1979). Reeves, Inc. v. Kelley, 441 U.S. 939 (1979).  On remand, the Court of Appeals distinguished that case. 4 Again relying on Alexandria Scrap, the court   abided by its previous holding.  Reeves, Inc. v. Kelley, 603 F.2d 736 (1979). We granted Reeves' petition for certiorari to consider once again the impact of the Commerce Clause on state proprietary activity.  444 U.S. 1031 (1980). 5

A
Alexandria Scrap concerned a Maryland program designed to remove abandoned automobiles from the State's roadways and junkyards.  To encourage recycling, a "bounty" was offered for every Maryland-titled junk car converted into scrap. Processors located both in and outside Maryland were eligible to collect these subsidies. The legislation, as initially enacted in 1969, required a processor seeking a bounty to present documentation evidencing ownership of the wrecked car.  This requirement however, did not apply to "hulks," inoperable automobiles over eight years old.  In 1974, the statute was amended to extend documentation   requirements to hulks, which comprised a large majority of the junk cars being processed.  Departing from prior practice, the new law imposed more exacting documentation requirements on out-of-state than in-state processors. By making it less remunerative for suppliers to transfer vehicles outside Maryland, the reform triggered a "precipitate decline in the number of bounty-eligible hulks supplied to appellee's  plant from Maryland sources." 426 U.S., at 801. Indeed, " practical effect was substantially the same as if Maryland had withdrawn altogether the availability of bounties on hulks delivered by unlicensed suppliers to licensed non-Maryland processors." Id ., at 803, n. 13; see id., at 819 (dissenting opinion).
Invoking the Commerce Clause, a three-judge District Court struck down the legislation.  391 F.Supp. 46 (Md. 1975). It observed that the amendment imposed "substantial burdens upon the free flow of interstate commerce," id., at 62, and reasoned that the discriminatory program was not the least disruptive means of achieving the State's articulated objective.  Id., at 63. See generally Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970). 6
This Court reversed.  It recognized the persuasiveness of the lower court's analysis if the inherent restrictions of the Commerce Clause were deemed applicable.  In the Court's view, however, Alexandria Scrap did not involve "the kind of action with which the Commerce Clause is concerned." 426 U.S., at 805. Unlike prior cases voiding state laws inhibiting interstate trade, "Maryland has not sought to prohibit the flow of hulks, or to regulate the conditions under which it may occur.  Instead, it has entered into the market itself to bid up their price," id., at 806, "as a purchaser, in effect, of a potential article of interstate commerce," and has restricted "its trade to its own   citizens or businesses within the State." Id., at 808. 7
Having characterized Maryland as a market participant, rather than as a market regulator, the Court found no reason to "believe the Commerce Clause was intended to require independent justification for  action." Id., at 809. The Court couched its holding in unmistakably broad terms. "Nothing in the purposes animating the Commerce Clause prohibits a State, in the absence of congressional action, from participating in the market and exercising the right to favor its own citizens over others." Id., at 810 (footnote omitted). 8
B
The basic distinction drawn in Alexandria Scrap between States as market participants and States as market regulators makes good sense and sound law.  As that case explains,   the Commerce Clause responds principally to state taxes and regulatory measures impeding free private trade in the national marketplace. Id., at 807-808, citing H. P. Hood & Sons v. Du Mond, 336 U.S. 525, 539 (1949) (referring to "home embargoes," "customs duties," and "regulations" excluding imports).  There is no indication of a constitutional plan to limit the ability of the States themselves to operate freely in the free market. See L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 336 (1978) ("the commerce clause was directed, as an historical matter, only at regulatory and taxing actions taken by states in their sovereign capacity").  The precedents comport with this distinction. 9
Restraint in this area is also counseled by considerations of state sovereignty, 10 the role of each State "'as guardian and trustee for its people,'" Heim v. McCall, 239 U.S. 175, 191 (1915), quoting Atkin v. Kansas, 191 U.S. 207, 222-223 (1903),11 and "the long recognized right of trader or manufacturer, engaged in an entirely private business, freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal." United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 307 (1919).12 Moreover, state proprietary activities may be, and often are, burdened with the same restrictions imposed on private market participants. 13 Evenhandedness   suggests that, when acting as proprietors, States should similarly share existing freedoms from federal constraints, including the inherent limits of the Commerce Clause. See State ex rel. Collins v. Senatobia Blank Book & Stationery Co., 115 Miss. 254, 260, 76 So. 258, 260 (1917);Tribune Printing & Binding Co. v. Barnes, 7 N. D. 591, 597, 75 N. W. 904, 906 (1898).Finally, as this case illustrates, the competing considerations in cases involving state proprietary action often will be subtle, complex, politically charged, and difficult to assess under traditional Commerce Clause analysis.  Given these factors, Alexandria Scrap wisely recognizes that, as a rule, the adjustment of interests in this context is a task better suited for Congress than this Court.
III
South Dakota, as a seller of cement, unquestionably fits the "market participant" label more comfortably than a State acting to subsidize local scrap processors. Thus, the general rule of Alexandria Scrap plainly applies here. 14 Petitioner argues, however, that the exemption for marketplace participation necessarily admits of exceptions.  While conceding that possibility, we perceive in this case no sufficient reason to depart from the general rule.
A
In finding a Commerce Clause violation, the District Court emphasized "that the Commission . . . made an election to become part of the interstate commerce system." App. 28.  The gist of this reasoning, repeated by petitioner here, is that one good turn deserves another.  Having long exploited the interstate market, South Dakota should not be permitted to withdraw from it when a shortage arises.  This argument is not persuasive.  It is somewhat self-serving to say that South Dakota has "exploited" the interstate market.  An equally fair characterization is that neighboring States long have benefited from South Dakota's foresight and industry.  Viewed in this light, it is not surprising that Alexandria Scrap rejected an argument that the 1974 Maryland legislation challenged there was invalid because cars abandoned in Maryland had been processed in neighboring States for five years.  As in Alexandria Scrap, we must conclude that "this chronology does not distinguish the case, for Commerce Clause purposes, from one in which a State offered  only to domestic  from the start." 426 U.S., at 809. 15
Our rejection of petitioner's market-exploitation theory fundamentally refocuses analysis.  It means that to reverse we would have to void a South Dakota "residents only" policy even if it had been enforced from the plant's very first days.  Such a holding, however, would interfere significantly with a State's ability to structure relations exclusively with its own citizens.  It would also threaten the future fashioning of effective and creative programs for solving local problems and distributing government largesse.  See n. 1, supra.  A healthy regard for federalism and good government renders us reluctant to risk these results.
"To stay experimentation in things social and economic is a grave responsibility.  Denial of the right to experiment may be fraught with serious consequences to the Nation.  It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country." New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).
B
Undaunted by these considerations, petitioner advances four more arguments for reversal:
First, petitioner protests that South Dakota's preference for its residents responds solely to the "non-governmental " of protectionism. Brief for Petitioner 25.  Therefore, petitioner argues, the policy is per se invalid. See Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U.S. 617, 624 (1978).
We find the label "protectionism" of little help in this context.  The State's refusal to sell to buyers other than South Dakotans is "protectionist" only in the sense that it limits benefits generated by a state program to those who fund the state treasury and whom the State was created to serve.  Petitioner's argument apparently also would characterize as "protectionist" rules restricting to state residents the enjoyment of state educational institutions, energy generated by a state-run plant, police and fire protection, and agricultural improvement and business development programs. Such policies, while perhaps "protectionist" in a loose sense, reflect the essential and patently unobjectionable purpose of state government -- to serve the citizens of the State. 16
Second, petitioner echoes the District Court's warning:
"If a state in this union, were allowed to hoard its commodities or resources for the use of their own residents only, a drastic situation might evolve.  For example, Pennsylvania or Wyoming might keep their coal, the northwest its timber, and the mining states their minerals.  The result being that embargo may be retaliated by embargo and commerce would be halted at state lines." App. 29.
See, e. g., Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm'n, 436 U.S. 371, 385-386 (1978). This argument, although rooted in the core purpose of the Commerce Clause, does not fit the present facts.  Cement is not a natural resource, like coal, timber, wild game, or minerals.  Cf.  Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U.S. 322 (1979) (minnows); Philadelphia v. New Jersey, supra (landfill sites); Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U.S. 553 (1923) (natural gas); West v. Kansas Natural Gas   Co., 221 U.S. 229 (1911) (same); Note, 32 Rutgers L. Rev. 741 (1979). It is the end product of a complex process whereby a costly physical plant and human labor act on raw materials.  South Dakota has not sought to limit access to the State's limestone or other materials used to make cement. Nor has it restricted the ability of private firms or sister States to set up plants within its borders.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 4.  Moreover, petitioner has not suggested that South Dakota possesses unique access to the materials needed to produce cement. 17 Whatever limits might exist on a State's ability to invoke the Alexandria Scrap exemption to hoard resources which by happenstance are found there, those limits do not apply here.
Third, it is suggested that the South Dakota program is infirm because it places South Dakota suppliers of ready-mix concrete at a competitive advantage in the out-of-state market; Wyoming suppliers, such as petitioner, have little chance against South Dakota suppliers who can purchase cement from the State's plant and freely sell beyond South Dakota's borders.
The force of this argument is seriously diminished, if not eliminated, by several considerations.  The argument necessarily implies that the South Dakota scheme would be unobjectionable if sales in other States were totally barred.  It therefore proves too much, for it would tolerate even a greater measure of protectionism and stifling of interstate commerce than the challenged system allows.  See K. S. B. Technical Sales Corp. v. North Jersey Dist. Water Supply Comm'n, 75 N. J. 272, 298, 381 A. 2d 774, 787 (1977) ("It would be odd indeed to find that when a state becomes less parochial . . . its purpose becomes suspect under the Commerce Clause").  Cf.  Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S., at 142 ("And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend . . . on whether  could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities").  Nor is it to be forgotten that Alexandria Scrap approved a state program that "not only . . . effectively  scrap processors with existing plants in Maryland from the pressures of competitors with nearby out-of-state plants, but  implicitly to extend similar protection to any competitor . . . willing to erect a scrap processing facility within Maryland's boundaries." 391 F.Supp., at 63. Finally, the competitive plight of out-of-state ready-mix suppliers cannot be laid solely at the feet of South Dakota.  It is attributable as well to their own States' not providing or attracting alternative sources of supply and to the suppliers' own failure to guard against shortages by executing long-term supply contracts with the South Dakota plant.
In its last argument, petitioner urges that, had South Dakota not acted, free market forces would have generated an appropriate level of supply at free market prices for all buyers in the region.  Having replaced free market forces, South Dakota should be forced to replicate how the free market would have operated under prevailing conditions.
This argument appears to us to be simplistic and speculative.  The very reason South Dakota built its plant was because the free market had failed adequately to supply the region with cement. See n. 1, supra.  There is no indication, and no way to know, that private industry would have moved into petitioner's market area, and would have ensured a supply of cement to petitioner either prior to or during the 1978 construction season.  Indeed, it is quite possible that petitioner would never have existed -- far less operated successfully for 20 years -- had it not been for South Dakota cement. 18
C
We conclude, then, that the arguments for invalidating South Dakota's resident-preference program are weak at best.  Whatever residual force inheres in them is more than offset by countervailing considerations of policy and fairness.  Reversal would discourage similar state projects, even though this project demonstrably has served the needs of state residents and has helped the entire region for more than a half century.  Reversal also would rob South Dakota of the intended benefit of its foresight, risk, and industry. 19 Under   these circumstances, there is no reason to depart from the general rule of Alexandria Scrap.
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals is affirmed.
It is so ordered.

DISSENT BY: POWELL
MR. JUSTICE POWELL, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS join, dissenting.
The South Dakota Cement Commission has ordered that in times of shortage the state cement plant must turn away out-of-state customers until all orders from South Dakotans are filled.  This policy represents precisely the kind of economic protectionism that the Commerce Clause was intended to prevent. 1 The Court, however, finds no violation of the Commerce Clause, solely because the State produces the cement. I agree with the Court that the State   of South Dakota may provide cement for its public needs without violating the Commerce Clause. But I cannot agree that South Dakota may withhold its cement from interstate commerce in order to benefit private citizens and businesses within the State.
I
The need to ensure unrestricted trade among the States created a major impetus for the drafting of the Constitution.  "The power over commerce . . . was one of the primary objects for which the people of America adopted their government. . . ." Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 190 (1824). Indeed, the Constitutional Convention was called after an earlier convention on trade and commercial problems proved inconclusive.  C. Beard, An Economic Interpretation of the   Constitution 61-63 (1935); S. Bloom, History of the Formation of the Union Under the Constitution 14-15 (1940).  In the subsequent debate over ratification, Alexander Hamilton emphasized the importance of unrestricted interstate commerce:
"An unrestrained intercourse between the States themselves will advance the trade of each, by an interchange of their respective productions. . . . Commercial enterprise will have much greater scope, from the diversity in the productions of different States.  When the staple of one fails . . . it can call to its aid the staple of another." The Federalist, No. 11, p. 71 (J. Cooke ed., 1961) (A. Hamilton); see id., No. 42, p. 283 (J. Madison).
The Commerce Clause has proved an effective weapon against protectionism. The Court has used it to strike down limitations on access to local goods, be they animal, Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U.S. 322 (1979) (minnows); vegetable, Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137 (1970) (cantaloupes); or mineral, Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U.S. 553 (1923) (natural gas).  Only this Term, the Court held unconstitutional a Florida statute designed to exclude out-of-state investment advisers.  Lewis v. BT Investment Managers, Inc., ante, p. 27.  As we observed in Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U.S. 794, 803 (1976), "this Nation is a common market in which state lines cannot be made barriers to the free flow of both raw materials and finished goods in response to the economic laws of supply and demand."
This case presents a novel constitutional question.  The Commerce Clause would bar legislation imposing on private parties the type of restraint on commerce adopted by South Dakota.  See Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, supra; cf. Great A&P Tea Co. v. Cottrell, 424 U.S. 366 (1976);  Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, 278 U.S. 1 (1928). 2 Conversely, a private   business constitutionally could adopt a marketing policy that excluded customers who come from another State.  This case falls between those polar situations. The State, through its Commission, engages in a commercial enterprise and restricts its own interstate distribution.  The question is whether the Commission's policy should be treated like state regulation of private parties or like the marketing policy of a private business.
The application of the Commerce Clause to this case should turn on the nature of the governmental activity involved.  If a public enterprise undertakes an "integral  in areas of traditional governmental functions," National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833, 852 (1976), the Commerce Clause is not directly relevant.  If, however, the State enters the private market and operates a commercial enterprise for the advantage of its private citizens, it may not evade the constitutional policy against economic Balkanization.
This distinction derives from the power of governments to supply their own needs, see Perkins v. Lukens Steel Co., 310 U.S. 113, 127 (1940); Atkin v. Kansas, 191 U.S. 207 (1903), and from the purpose of the Commerce Clause itself, which is designed to protect "the natural functioning of the interstate market," Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., supra, at 806. In procuring goods and services for the operation of government, a State may act without regard to the private marketplace and remove itself from the reach of the Commerce Clause. See American   Yearbook Co. v. Askew, 339 F.Supp. 719 (MD Fla.), summarily aff'd, 409 U.S. 904 (1972). But when a State itself becomes a participant in the private market for other purposes, the Constitution forbids actions that would impede the flow of interstate commerce. These categories recognize no more than the "constitutional line between the State as government and the State as trader." New York v. United States, 326 U.S. 572, 579 (1946); see United States v. California, 297 U.S. 175 (1936); Ohio v. Helvering, 292 U.S. 360 (1934); South Carolina v. United States, 199 U.S. 437 (1905).
The Court holds that South Dakota, like a private business, should not be governed by the Commerce Clause when it enters the private market.  But precisely because South Dakota is a State, it cannot be presumed to behave like an enterprise "'engaged in an entirely private business.'" See ante, at 439, quoting United States v. Colgate & Co., 250 U.S. 300, 307 (1919). A State frequently will respond to market conditions on the basis of  political rather than economic concerns.  To use the Court's terms, a State may attempt to act as a "market regulator" rather than a "market participant." See ante, at 436.  In that situation, it is a pretense to equate the State with a private economic actor.  State action burdening interstate trade is no less state action because it is accomplished by a public agency authorized to participate in the private market.
II
The threshold issue is whether South Dakota has undertaken integral government operations in an area of traditional governmental functions, or whether it has participated in the marketplace as a private firm.  If the latter characterization applies, we also must determine whether the State Commission's marketing policy burdens the flow of interstate trade. This analysis highlights the differences between the state action here and that before the Court in Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp.
A
In Alexandria Scrap, a Virginia scrap processor challenged a Maryland program to pay bounties for every junk car registered in Maryland that was converted into scrap. The program imposed more onerous documentation standards on non-Maryland processors,  thereby diverting Maryland "hulks" to in-state processors. The Virginia plaintiff argued that this diversion burdened interstate commerce.
As the Court today notes, Alexandria Scrap determined that Maryland's bounty program constituted direct state participation in the market for automobile hulks. Ante, at 435.  But the critical question -- the second step in the opinion's analysis -- was whether the bounty program constituted an impermissible burden on interstate commerce. Recognizing that the case did not fit neatly into conventional Commerce Clause theory, 426 U.S., at 807, we found no burden on commerce.
The Court first observed:
"Maryland has not sought to prohibit the flow of hulks, or to regulate the conditions under which it may occur.  Instead, it has entered into the market itself to bid up their price.  There has been an impact upon the interstate flow of hulks only because . . . Maryland effectively has made it more lucrative for unlicensed suppliers to dispose of their hulks in Maryland. . . ." Id., at 806.
We further stated "that the novelty of this case is not its presentation of a new form of 'burden' upon commerce, but that appellee should characterize Maryland's action as a burden which the Commerce Clause was intended to make suspect." Id., at 807. The opinion then emphasized that "no trade barrier of the type forbidden by the Commerce Clause, and involved in previous cases, impedes  movement  out of State." Id., at 809-810 . Rather, the hulks "remain within Maryland in response to market forces, including that exerted by money from the State." Id., at 810. The Court concluded that the subsidies provided under the Maryland program erected no barriers to trade.  Consequently, the Commerce Clause did not forbid the Maryland program.
B
Unlike the market subsidies at issue in Alexandria Scrap, the marketing policy of the South Dakota Cement Commission has cut off interstate trade. 3 The State can raise such a bar when it enters the market to supply its own needs.  In order to ensure an adequate supply of cement for public uses, the State can withhold from interstate commerce the cement needed for public projects.  Cf. National League of Cities v. Usery, supra.
The State, however, has no parallel justification for favoring private, in-state customers over out-of-state customers. 4 In response to political concerns that likely would be inconsequential to a private cement producer, South Dakota has shut off its cement sales to customers beyond its borders.  That discrimination constitutes a direct barrier to trade "of the type forbidden by the Commerce Clause, and involved in previous cases. . . ." Alexandria Scrap, 426 U.S., at 810. The effect on interstate trade is the same as if the state legislature had imposed the policy on private cement producers. The Commerce Clause prohibits this severe restraint on commerce.
III
I share the Court's desire to preserve state sovereignty.  But the Commerce Clause long has been recognized as a limitation on that sovereignty, consciously designed to maintain a national market and defeat economic provincialism.  The Court today approves protectionist state policies.  In the absence of contrary   congressional action, 5 those policies now can be implemented as long as the State itself directly participates in the market. 6
By enforcing the Commerce Clause in this case, the Court would work no unfairness on the people of South Dakota.  They still could reserve cement for public projects and share in whatever return the plant generated.  They could not, however, use the power of the State to furnish themselves with cement forbidden to the people of neighboring States.
The creation of a free national economy was a major goal of the States when they resolved to unite under the Federal Constitution.  The decision today cannot be reconciled with that purpose.
