OPINION
JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.
Appellant San Diego Gas & Electric Company, a California corporation, asks this Court to rule that a State must provide a monetary remedy to a landowner whose property allegedly has been "taken" by a regulatory ordinance claimed to violate the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment. 1 This question was left open last Term in Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255, 263 (1980). Because we conclude that we lack jurisdiction in this case, we again must leave the issue undecided.
I
Appellant owns a 412-acre parcel of land in Sorrento Valley, an area in the northwest part of the city of San Diego, Cal.  It assembled and acquired the acreage in 1966, at a cost of about $ 1,770,000, as a possible site for a nuclear power plant to be constructed in the 1980's.  Approximately 214 acres of the parcel lie within or near an estuary known as the Los Penasquitos Lagoon. 2 These acres are low-lying land which serves as a drainage basin for three river systems.  About a third of the land is subject to tidal action from the nearby Pacific Ocean.  The 214 acres are unimproved, except for sewer and utility lines. 3
When appellant acquired the 214 acres, most of the land was zoned either for industrial use or in an agricultural "holding" category. 4 The   city's master plan, adopted in 1967, designated nearly all the area for industrial use.
Several events that occurred in 1973 gave rise to this litigation.  First, the San Diego City Council rezoned parts of the property.  It changed 39 acres from industrial to agricultural, and increased the minimum lot size in some of the agricultural areas from 1 acre to 10 acres. The Council recommended, however, that 50 acres of the agricultural land be considered for industrial development upon the submission of specific development plans.
Second, the city, pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code Ann. § 65563 (West Supp. 1981), established an open-space plan.  This statute required each California city and county to adopt a plan "for the comprehensive and long-range preservation and conservation of open-space land within its jurisdiction." The plan adopted by the city of San Diego placed appellant's property among the city's open-space areas, which it defined as "any urban land or water surface that is essentially open or natural in character, and which has appreciable utility for park and recreation purposes, conservation of land, water or other natural resources or historic or scenic purposes." App. 159.  The plan acknowledged appellant's intention to construct a nuclear power plant on the property, stating that such a plant would not necessarily be incompatible with the open-space designation. 5 The plan proposed, however, that the city acquire the property to preserve it as parkland.
Third, the City Council proposed a bond issue in order to obtain funds to acquire open-space lands.  The Council identified appellant's land as among those properties to be acquired with the proceeds of the bond issue.  The proposition, however, failed to win the voters' approval.  The open-space plan has remained in effect, but the city has made no attempt to acquire appellant's property.
On August 15, 1974, appellant instituted this action in the Superior Court for the County of San Diego against the city and a number of its officials.  It alleged that the city had taken its property without just compensation, in violation of the Constitutions of the United States and California. Appellant's theory was that the city had deprived it of the entire beneficial use of the property through the rezoning and the adoption of the open-space plan.  It alleged that the city followed a policy of refusing to approve any development that was inconsistent with the plan, and that the only beneficial use of the property was as an industrial park, a use that would be inconsistent with the open-space designation. 6    The city disputed this allegation, arguing that appellant had never asked its approval for any development plan for the property.  It also contended that, as a charter city, it was not bound by the open-space plan, even if appellant's proposed development would be inconsistent with the plan, citing Cal. Gov't Code Ann. §§ 65700, 65803 (West 1966 and Supp. 1981).
Appellant sought damages of $ 6,150,000 in inverse condemnation, as well as mandamus and declaratory relief. Prior to trial, the court dismissed the mandamus claim, holding that "mandamus is not the proper remedy to challenge the validity of a legislative act." Clerk's Tr. 42.  After a nonjury trial on the issue of liability, the court granted judgment for appellant, finding that:
"29.   continuing course of conduct of the defendant City culminating in June of 1973, and, in particular, the designation of substantially all of the subject property as open space . . . , plaintiff has been deprived of all practical, beneficial or economic use of the property designated as open space, and has further suffered severance damage with respect to the balance of the subject property.
"30.  No development could proceed on the property designated as open space unless it was consistent with open space. In light of the particular characteristics of the said property, there exists no practical, beneficial or economic use of the said property designated as open space which is consistent with open space.
"31.  Since June 19, 1973, the property designated as open space has been devoted to use by the public as open space.
"32.  Following the actions of the defendant City in June of 1973, it would have been totally impractical and futile for plaintiff to have applied to defendant City for the approval of any development of the property designated as open space or the remainder of the subject property.
"33.  Since the actions of the defendant City in June of 1973, the property designated as open space and the remainder of the larger parcel is unmarketable in that no other person would be willing to purchase the property, and the property has at most a nominal fair market value." App. 41-42.
The court concluded that these findings established that the city had taken the property and that just compensation was required by the Constitutions of both the United States and California.  A subsequent jury trial on the question of damages resulted in a judgment for appellant for over $ 3 million.
On appeal, the California Court of Appeal, Fourth District, affirmed.  App. to Juris. Statement B-1; see 146 Cal. Rptr. 103 (1978). It held that neither a change in zoning nor the adoption of an open-space plan automatically entitled a property owner to compensation for any resulting diminution in the value of the property.  In this case, however, the record revealed that the city followed the policy of enacting and enforcing zoning ordinances that were consistent with its open-space plan.  The Court of Appeal also found that the evidence supported the conclusion that industrial use was the only feasible use for the property and that the city would have denied any application for industrial development because it would be incompatible with the open-space designation.  Appellant's failure to present a plan for developing the property therefore did not preclude an award of damages in its favor.  The Court of Appeal, with one judge dissenting, denied the city's petition for rehearing.  See 146 Cal. Rptr., at 118.
The Supreme Court of California, however, on July 13, 1978, granted the city's petition for a hearing.  This action automatically vacated the Court of Appeal's decision, depriving it of all effect.  Knouse v. Nimocks, 8 Cal. 2d 482, 483-484, 66 P. 2d 438 (1937). See also Cal. Rules of Court 976 (d)   and 977 (West 1981).  Before the hearing,  the Supreme Court in June 1979 retransferred the case to the Court of Appeal for reconsideration in light of the intervening decision in Agins v. City of Tiburon, 24 Cal. 3d 266, 598 P. 2d 25 (1979), aff'd, 447 U.S. 255 (1980). 7 The California court in Agins held that an owner who is deprived of substantially all beneficial use of his land by a zoning regulation is not entitled to an award of damages in an inverse condemnation proceeding.  Rather, his exclusive remedy is invalidation of the regulation in an action for mandamus or declaratory relief. 8 Agins   also held that the plaintiffs in that case were not entitled to such relief because the zoning ordinance at issue permitted the building of up to five residences on their property.  Therefore, the court held, it did not deprive those plaintiffs of substantially all reasonable use of their land. 9
When the present case was retransferred, the Court of Appeal, in an unpublished opinion, reversed the judgment of the Superior Court.  App. 63.  It relied upon the California decision in Agins and held that appellant could not recover compensation through inverse condemnation. It, however, did not invalidate either the zoning ordinance or the open-space plan.  Instead, it held that factual disputes precluded such relief on the present state of the record:
" complains it has been denied all use of its land which is zoned for agriculture and manufacturing but lies within the open space area of the general plan.  It has not made application to use or improve the property nor has it asked  City what development might be permitted.  Even assuming no use is acceptable to the City,  complaint deals with the alleged overzealous use of the police power by  City.  Its remedy is mandamus or declaratory relief, not inverse condemnation.  did in its complaint seek these remedies asserting that  City had arbitrarily exercised its police power by enacting an unconstitutional zoning law and general plan element or by applying the zoning and general plan unconstitutionally.  However, on the present record these are disputed fact issues not covered by the trial court in its findings and conclusions.  They can be dealt with anew should  elect to retry the case." App. 66.
The Supreme Court of California denied further review.  App. to Juris. Statement I-1.  Appellant appealed to this Court, arguing that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments require that compensation be paid whenever private property is taken for public use. Appellant takes issue with the California Supreme Court's holding in Agins that its remedy is limited to invalidation of the ordinance in a proceeding for mandamus or declaratory relief. We postponed consideration of our jurisdiction until the hearing on the merits.  447 U.S. 919 (1980). We now conclude that the appeal must be dismissed because of the absence of a final judgment. 10
II
In Agins, the California Supreme Court held that mandamus or declaratory relief is available whenever a zoning regulation is claimed to effect an uncompensated taking in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court of Appeal's failure, therefore, to award such relief in this case clearly indicates its conclusion that the record does not support appellant's claim that an uncompensated taking has occurred. 11 Because the court found that the record presented "disputed fact issues not covered by the trial court in its findings and conclusions," App. 66, 12 it held that mandamus and declaratory relief would be available "should  elect to retry the case." Ibid.  While this phrase appears to us to be somewhat ambiguous, we read it as meaning that appellant is to have an opportunity on remand to convince the trial court to resolve the disputed issues in its favor.  We do not believe that the Court of Appeal was holding that judgment must be entered for the city.  It certainly did not so direct.  This indicates that appellant is free to pursue its quest for relief in the Superior Court.  The logical course of action for an appellate court that finds unresolved factual disputes in the record is to remand the case for the resolution of those disputes.  We therefore conclude that the Court of Appeal's decision contemplates further proceedings in the trial court. 13
III
Ever since this Court's decision in Grays Harbor Co. v. Coats-Fordney Co., 243 U.S. 251 (1917),  a state court's   holding that private property has been taken in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and that further proceedings are necessary to determine the compensation that must be paid has been regarded as a classic example of a decision not reviewable in this Court because it is not "final." In such a case, "the remaining litigation may raise other federal questions that may later come here." Radio Station WOW, Inc. v. Johnson, 326 U.S. 120, 127 (1945). This is because "the federal constitutional question embraces not only a taking, but a taking on payment of just compensation.  A state judgment is not final unless it covers both aspects of that integral problem." North Dakota Board of Pharmacy v. Snyder's Drug Stores, Inc., 414 U.S. 156, 163 (1973).
This case presents the reverse aspect of that situation.  The Court of Appeal has decided that monetary compensation is not an appropriate remedy for any taking of appellant's property that may have occurred, but it has not decided whether any other remedy is available because it has not decided whether any taking in fact has occurred.  Thus, however we might rule with respect to the Court of Appeal's decision that appellant is not entitled to a monetary remedy -- and we are frank to say that the federal constitutional aspects of that issue are not to be cast aside lightly -- further proceedings are necessary to resolve the federal question whether there has been a taking at all.  The court's decision, therefore, is not final, and we are without jurisdiction to review it.
Because § 1257 permits us to review only " judgments or decrees" of a state court,  the appeal must be, and is, dismissed.
It is so ordered.

CONCUR BY: REHNQUIST
JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concurring.
If I were satisfied that this appeal was from a "final judgment or decree" of the California Court of Appeal, as that term is used in 28 U. S. C. § 1257, I would have little difficulty in agreeing with much of what is said in the dissenting opinion of JUSTICE BRENNAN.  Indeed, the Court's opinion notes that "the federal constitutional aspects of that issue are not to be cast aside lightly. . . ." Ante, at 633.
But "the judicial Power of the United States" which is vested in this Court by Art. III of the Constitution is divided by that article into original jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction.  With respect to appellate jurisdiction, Art. III provides:
"   In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make."
The particular "regulation" of our appellate jurisdiction here relevant is found in 28 U. S. C. § 1257, which provides:
"Final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in  which a decision could be had, may be reviewed by the Supreme Court as follows:
. . . .
"(2) By appeal, where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of any state on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of its validity."
The principal case construing § 1257 is Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U.S. 469 (1975), from which I dissented on the issue of finality.  In Cox, the Court said:
"The Court has noted that ' of English usage as well as those of judicial policy' would justify an interpretation of the final-judgment rule to preclude review 'where anything further remains to be determined by a State court, no matter how dissociated from the only federal issue that has finally been adjudicated by the highest court of the State.' Radio Station WOW, Inc. v. Johnson, 326 U.S. 120, 124 (1945). But the Court there observed that the rule had not been administered in such a mechanical fashion and that there were circumstances in which there had been 'a departure from this requirement of finality for federal appellate jurisdiction.' Ibid.
"These circumstances were said to be 'very few,' ibid.; but as the cases have unfolded, the Court has recurringly encountered situations in which the highest court of a State has finally determined the federal issue present in a particular case, but in which there are further proceedings in the lower state courts to come.  There are now at least four categories of such cases in which the Court has treated the decision of the federal issue as a final judgment for the purposes of 28 U. S. C. § 1257 and has taken jurisdiction without awaiting the completion of the additional proceedings anticipated in the lower state courts." Id., at 477.
In Cox, the Court stated that the fourth category of cases which fell within the ambit of § 1257 finality were "those situations where the federal issue has been finally decided in the state courts with further proceedings pending in which the party seeking review here might prevail on the merits on nonfederal grounds, thus rendering unnecessary review of the federal issue by this Court, and where reversal of the state court on the federal issue would be preclusive of any further litigation on the relevant cause of action rather than merely controlling the nature and character of, or determining the admissibility of evidence in, the state proceedings still to come.  In these circumstances, if a refusal to immediately review the state-court decision might seriously erode federal policy, the Court has entertained and decided the federal issue, which itself has been finally determined by the state courts for purposes of the state litigation." Id., at 482-483.
I am not sure under how many of the four exceptions of Cox JUSTICE BRENNAN may view this case as falling, but it seems to me that this case illustrates the problems which arise from a less-than-literal reading of the language "final judgment or decree." The procedural history of this case in the state courts is anomalous, to say the least, and it has resulted in a majority of this Court concluding that the California courts have not decided whether any taking in fact has occurred, ante, at 631, n. 11, and JUSTICE BRENNAN concluding that the Court of Appeal has held that the city of San Diego's course of conduct could not effect a "taking" of appellant's property.  Post, at 661, n. 27. Having read the characterization of the California court proceedings in the opinion of this Court and in the opinion of JUSTICE BRENNAN as carefully as I can, I can only conclude that they disagree as to what issues remain open on remand from the State Court of Appeal to the Superior Court, but agree that such proceedings may occur.
Under these circumstances, it seems to me to be entirely in accord with the language of 28 U. S. C. § 1257, though perhaps not entirely in accord with the above-quoted portion of the opinion in Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, supra, to conclude that this appeal is not from a "final judgment or decree." I would feel much better able to formulate federal constitutional principles of damages for land-use regulation which amounts to a taking of land under the Eminent Domain Clause of the Fifth Amendment if I knew what disposition the California courts finally made of this case.  Because I do not, and cannot at this stage of the litigation, know that, I join the opinion of the Court today in which the appeal is dismissed for want of a final judgment.
<dissent author="BRENNAN" text="TRUE">
DISSENT BY: BRENNAN
JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom JUSTICE STEWART, JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE POWELL join, dissenting.
Title 28 U. S. C. § 1257 limits this Court's jurisdiction to review judgments of state courts to " judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had." The Court today dismisses this appeal on the ground that the Court of Appeal of California, Fourth District, failed to decide the federal question whether a "taking" of appellant's property had occurred, and therefore had not entered a final judgment or decree on that question appealable under § 1257. Because the Court's conclusion fundamentally mischaracterizes the holding and judgment of the Court of Appeal, I respectfully dissent from the Court's dismissal and reach the merits of appellant's claim.
I
In 1966, appellant assembled a 412-acre parcel of land as a potential site for a nuclear power plant. At that time, approximately 116 acres of the property were zoned for industrial use, with most of the balance zoned in an agricultural holding category.  In 1967, appellee city of San Diego adopted its general plan designating most of appellant's property for industrial use.  In 1973, the city took three critical actions which together form the predicate of the instant litigation: it down-zoned some of appellant's property from industrial to agricultural; it incorporated a new open-space element in its plan that designated about 233 acres of appellant's land for open-space use; 1 and it prepared a report mapping appellant's property for purchase by the city for open-space use, contingent on passage of a bond issue.  App. 49.
Appellant filed suit in California Superior Court alleging, inter alia, a "taking" of its property by "inverse condemnation" in violation of the United States and California Constitutions, 2 and seeking compensation of over $ 6 million.  After a nonjury trial on liability, the court held that appellee city had taken a portion of appellant's property without just compensation, thereby violating the United States and California Constitutions.  Id., at 42-43.  A subsequent jury trial on damages resulted in a judgment of over $ 3 million, plus interest as of the date of the "taking," and appraisal, engineering, and attorney's fees.  Id., at 46.
The California Court of Appeal, Fourth District, affirmed, holding that there was "substantial evidence to support the court's conclusion  there was inverse condemnation." Id., at 54.  The California Supreme Court granted the city's petition for a hearing, App. to Juris. Statement D-1, but later transferred the case back to the Court of Appeal for reconsideration in light of Agins v. City of Tiburon, 24 Cal. 3d 266, 598 P. 2d 25 (1979), aff'd, 447 U.S. 255 (1980). App. to Juris. Statement E-1.  Expressly relying on Agins, the   Court of Appeal this time reversed the Superior Court, holding:
"Unlike the person whose property is taken in eminent domain, the individual who is deprived of his property due to the state's exercise of its police power is not entitled to compensation. . . .  A local entity's arbitrary unconstitutional   exercise of the police power which deprives the owner of the beneficial use of his land does not require compensation; rather the party's remedy is administrative mandamus. . . ." App. 65-66.
The California Supreme Court denied further review.  App. to Juris. Statement I-1.
II
The Court today holds that the judgment below is not "final" within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. § 1257 because, although the California Court of Appeal "has decided that monetary compensation is not an appropriate remedy for any taking of appellant's property that may have occurred, . . . it has not decided whether any other remedy is available because it has not decided whether any taking in fact has occurred." Ante, at 633 (emphasis added).  With all due respect, this conclusion misreads the holding of the Court of Appeal.  In faithful compliance with the instructions of the California Supreme Court's opinion in Agins v. City of Tiburon, supra, the Court of Appeal held that the city's exercise of its police power, however arbitrary or excessive, could not as a matter of federal constitutional law constitute a "taking" under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and therefore that there was no "taking" without just compensation in the instant case.
Examination of the Court of Appeal's opinion and the California Supreme Court's Agins opinion confirms this reading.  As indicated above, the Court of Appeal noted that, " the person whose property is taken in eminent domain, the individual who is deprived of his property due to the state's exercise of its police power is not entitled to compensation." App. 65-66 (emphasis added).  Under the Court of Appeal's view, there can be no Fifth Amendment "taking" outside of the eminent domain context.  Thus, a "local entity's arbitrary unconstitutional exercise of the police power which deprives the owner of the beneficial use of his land does not require compensation; rather the party's remedy is administrative mandamus." Id., at 66 (emphasis added). 3
The Court of Appeal's analysis was required by the California Supreme Court's opinion in Agins v. City of Tiburon, supra.  There the court stated:
"Plaintiffs contend that the limitations on the use of their land imposed by the ordinance constitute an unconstitutional 'taking of  property without payment of just compensation' for which an action in inverse condemnation will lie.  Inherent in the contention is the argument that a local entity's exercise of its police power which, in a given case, may exceed constitutional limits is equivalent to the lawful taking of property by eminent domain thereby necessitating the payment of compensation.  We are unable to accept this argument believing the preferable view to be that, while such governmental action is invalid because of its excess, remedy by way of damages in eminent domain is not thereby made available." 24 Cal. 3d, at 272, 598 P. 2d, at 28 (brackets in original) (emphasis added). 4
A landowner may not "elect to sue in inverse condemnation and thereby transmute an excessive use of the police power into a lawful taking for which compensation in eminent domain must be paid." Id., at 273, 598 P. 2d, at 28 (emphasis added). 5
This Court therefore errs, I respectfully submit, when it concludes that the Court of Appeal "has not decided whether any taking in fact has occurred." Ante, at 633.  For whatever the merits of the California courts' substantive rulings on the federal constitutional issue, see infra, at 646-661, it is clear that the California Supreme Court has held that California courts in a challenge, as here, to a police power regulation, are barred from holding that a Fifth Amendment "taking" requiring just compensation has occurred. 6 No set of factual circumstances, no matter how severe, can "transmute" an arbitrary exercise of the city's police power into a Fifth Amendment "taking." Agins v. City of Tiburon, supra, at 273, 598 P. 2d, at 28. This Court's focus on the last full paragraph of the Court of Appeal decision, ante, at 630, to support its conclusion is misplaced, because that paragraph merely raises the possibility that appellant may "elect to retry the case" on a different constitutional theory -- an allegation of "overzealous use of the police power," App. 66.  Whatever factual findings of the trial court might be relevant to that inquiry, they would have no bearing on a Fifth Amendment "taking" claim. 7 Therefore, the Court's suggestion    that "further proceedings are necessary to resolve the federal question whether there has been a taking at all," is plainly wrong.  Ante, at 633. 8
The trial court has held expressly that the "actions of defendant City . . . taken as a whole, constitute a taking of the portion of plaintiff's property designated as open space without due process of law and just compensation within the meaning of the California and United States constitutions." App. 42-43 (emphasis added).  The Court of Appeal reversed this holding and concluded as a matter of law that no Fifth Amendment "taking" had occurred.  This is indistinguishable, then, from a dismissal of appellant's case for legal insufficiency.  In any such dismissal, factual questions are necessarily left unresolved.  But when a litigant is denied relief as a matter of law, the judgment is necessarily final within the meaning of § 1257. See, e. g., Allenberg Cotton Co. v. Pittman, 419 U.S. 20, 24-25 (1974); Windward Shipping v. American Radio Assn., 415 U.S. 104, 108 (1974). 9
Since the Court of Appeal held that no Fifth Amendment "taking" had occurred, no just compensation was required.  This is a classic final judgment. See North Dakota Pharmacy Bd. v. Snyder's Drug Stores, Inc., 414 U.S. 156, 163 (1973); Grays Harbor Logging Co. v. Coats-Fordney Logging Co., 243 U.S. 251, 256 (1917). I therefore dissent from the dismissal of this appeal, and address the merits of the question presented. 10
III
The Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, Webb's   Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155, 160 (1980); see Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U.S. 226, 239, 241 (1897), states in clear and unequivocal terms: " shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation." The question presented on the merits in this case is whether a government entity must pay just compensation when a police power regulation has effected a "taking" of "private property" for "public use" within the meaning of that constitutional provision. 11 Implicit in this question is the corollary issue   whether a government entity's exercise of its regulatory police power can ever effect a "taking" within the meaning of the Just Compensation Clause. 12
A
As explained in Part II, supra, the California courts have held that a city's exercise of its police power, however arbitrary or excessive, cannot as a matter of federal constitutional law constitute a "taking" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. This holding flatly contradicts clear precedents of this Court.  For example, in last Term's Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255, 260 (1980), the Court noted that " application of a general zoning law to particular property effects a taking if the ordinance does not substantially advance legitimate state interests . . . or  denies an owner economically viable use of his land . . . ." 13 Applying that principle, the Court examined whether the Tiburon zoning ordinance effected a "taking" of the Agins' property, concluding that it did not have such an effect. Id., at 262-263.
In Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104 (1978), the Court analyzed "whether the restrictions imposed by New York City's  law upon appellants' exploitation of the  Terminal site effect a 'taking' of appellants'  property . . . within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment." Id., at 122. Canvassing the appropriate inquiries necessary to determine whether a particular restriction effected a "taking," the Court identified the "economic impact of the regulation on the claimant" and the "character of the governmental action" as particularly relevant considerations. Id., at 124; see id., at 130-131. Although the Court ultimately concluded that application of New York's Landmarks Law did not effect a "taking" of the railroad property, it did so only after deciding that " restrictions imposed are substantially related to the promotion of the general welfare and not only permit reasonable beneficial use of the landmark site but also afford appellants opportunities further to enhance not only the Terminal site proper but also other properties." Id., at 138 (footnote omitted).
The constitutionality of a local ordinance regulating dredging and pit excavating on a property was addressed in Goldblatt v. Town of Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590 (1962). After observing that an otherwise valid zoning ordinance that deprives the owner of the most beneficial use of his property would not be unconstitutional, id., at 592, the Court cautioned: "That is not to say, however, that governmental action in the form of regulation cannot be so onerous as to constitute a taking which constitutionally requires compensation," id., at 594. On many other occasions, the Court has recognized in passing the vitality of the general principle that a regulation can effect a Fifth Amendment "taking." See, e. g., PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74, 83   (1980); Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U.S. 164, 174   (1979); Andrus v. Allard, 444 U.S. 51, 65-66 (1979); United States v. Central Eureka Mining Co., 357 U.S. 155, 168 (1958).
The principle applied in all these cases has its source in Justice Holmes' opinion for the Court in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 415 (1922), in which he stated: "The general rule at least is, that while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it  will be recognized as a taking." 14 The determination of a "taking" is "a question of degree -- and therefore cannot be disposed of by general propositions." Id., at 416. 15 While acknowledging that " hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law," id., at 413 , the Court rejected the proposition that police power restrictions could never be recognized as a Fifth Amendment "taking." 16 Indeed, the Court concluded that the Pennsylvania statute forbidding the mining of coal that would cause the subsidence of any house effected a "taking." Id., at 414-416. 17
B
Not only does the holding of the California Court of Appeal contradict precedents of this Court, but it also fails to recognize the essential similarity of regulatory "takings" and other "takings." The typical "taking" occurs when a government entity formally condemns a landowner's property and obtains the fee simple pursuant to its sovereign power of eminent domain. See, e. g., Berman v. Parker, 348 U.S. 26, 33 (1954). However, a "taking" may also occur without a formal condemnation proceeding or transfer of fee simple.  This Court long ago recognized that
" would be a very curious and unsatisfactory result, if in construing  . . . it shall be held that if the government refrains from the absolute conversion of real property to the uses of the public it can destroy its value entirely, can inflict irreparable and permanent injury to any extent, can, in effect, subject it to total destruction without making any compensation, because, in the narrowest sense of that word, it is not taken for the public use." Pumpelly v. Green Bay Co., 13 Wall. 166, 177-178 (1872) (emphasis in original).
See Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co. v. United States, 284 U.S. 80, 96 (1931).
In service of this principle, the Court frequently has found "takings" outside the context of formal condemnation proceedings or transfer of fee simple, in cases where government action benefiting the public resulted in destruction of the use and enjoyment of private property.  E. g., Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U.S., at 178-180 (navigational servitude allowing public right of access); United States v. Dickinson, 331 U.S. 745, 750-751   (1947) (property flooded because of Government dam project); United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256, 261-262 (1946) (frequent low altitude flights of Army and Navy aircraft over property); Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S., at 414-416 (state regulation forbidding mining of coal).
Police power regulations such as zoning ordinances and other land-use restrictions can destroy the use and enjoyment of property in order to promote the public good just as effectively as formal condemnation or physical invasion of property.  18 From the property owner's point of view, it may matter little whether his land is condemned or flooded, or whether it is restricted by regulation to use in its natural state, if the effect in both cases is to deprive him of all beneficial use of it.  From the government's point of view, the benefits flowing to the public from preservation of open space through regulation may be equally great as from creating a wildlife refuge through formal condemnation or increasing electricity production through a dam project that floods private property.  Appellees implicitly posit the distinction that the government intends to take property through condemnation or physical invasion whereas it does not through police power regulations. See Brief for Appellees 43.  But "the Constitution measures a taking of property not by what a State says, or by what it intends, but by what it does." Hughes v. Washington, 389 U.S. 290, 298 (1967) (STEWART, J., concurring) (emphasis in original); see Davis v. Newton Coal Co., 267 U.S. 292, 301 (1925). It is only logical, then, that government action other than acquisition of title, occupancy,  or physical invasion can be a "taking," and therefore a de facto exercise of the power of eminent domain, where the effects completely deprive the owner of all or most of his interest in the property.  United States v. Dickinson, supra, at 748; United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373, 378 (1945).

Having determined that property may be "taken for public use" by police power regulation within the meaning of the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the question remains whether a government entity may constitutionally deny payment of just compensation to the property owner and limit his remedy to mere invalidation of the regulation instead.  Appellant argues that it is entitled to the full fair market value of the property.  Appellees argue that invalidation of the regulation is sufficient without payment of monetary compensation.  In my view, once a court establishes that there was a regulatory "taking," the Constitution demands that the government entity pay just compensation for the period commencing on the date the regulation first effected the "taking," and ending on the date the government entity chooses to rescind or otherwise amend 19 the regulation. 20 This interpretation, I believe, is supported by the express words and purpose of the Just Compensation Clause, as well as by cases of this Court construing it.
The language of the Fifth Amendment prohibits the "" of private property for "public use" without payment of "just compensation." As soon as private property has been taken, whether through formal condemnation proceedings, occupancy, physical invasion, or regulation, the landowner has already suffered a constitutional violation, and "'the self-executing character of the constitutional provision with respect to compensation,'" United States v. Clarke , 445 U.S. 253, 257 (1980), quoting 6 J. Sackman, Nichols' Law of Eminent Domain § 25.41 (rev. 3d ed.  1980), is triggered.  This Court has consistently recognized that the just compensation requirement in the Fifth Amendment is not precatory: once there is a "taking," compensation must be awarded.  In Jacobs v. United States, 290 U.S. 13 (1933), for example, a Government dam project creating intermittent overflows onto petitioners' property resulted in the "taking" of a servitude.  Petitioners brought suit against the Government to recover just compensation for the partial "taking." Commenting on the nature of the landowners' action, the Court observed:
"The suits were based on the right to recover just compensation for property taken by the United States for public use in the exercise of its power of eminent domain. That right was guaranteed by the Constitution.  The fact that condemnation proceedings were not instituted and that the right was asserted in suits by the owners did not change the essential nature of the claim.  The form of the remedy did not qualify the right.  It rested upon the Fifth Amendment. Statutory recognition was not necessary.  A promise to pay was not necessary.   Such a promise was implied because of the duty to pay imposed by the Amendment." Id., at 16.
See also Griggs v. Allegheny County, 369 U.S. 84, 84-85, 88-90 (1962); United States v. Causby, 328 U.S., at 268. 21    Invalidation unaccompanied by payment of damages would hardly compensate the landowner for any economic loss suffered during the time his property was taken. 22
Moreover, mere invalidation would fall far short of fulfilling the fundamental purpose of the Just Compensation Clause.  That guarantee was designed to bar the government from forcing some individuals to bear burdens which, in all fairness, should be borne by the public as a whole.  Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960). See Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S., at 260; Andrus v. Allard, 444 U.S., at 65. When one person is asked to assume more than a fair share of the public burden, the payment of just compensation operates to redistribute that economic cost from the individual to the public at large.  See United States v. Willow River Co., 324 U.S. 499, 502 (1945); Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, 148 U.S. 312, 325 (1893). Because police power regulations must be substantially related to the advancement of the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare, see Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U.S. 365, 395 (1926), it is axiomatic that the public receives a benefit while the offending regulation is in effect. 23 If the regulation denies the private property owner the use and enjoyment of his land and is found to effect a "taking," it is only fair that the public bear the cost of benefits received during the interim period between application of the regulation and the government entity's rescission of it.  The payment of just compensation serves to place the landowner in the same position monetarily as he would have occupied if his property had not been taken.  Almota Farmers Elevator & Warehouse Co. v. United States, 409 U.S. 470, 473-474   (1973); United States v. Reynolds, 397 U.S. 14, 16 (1970).
The fact that a regulatory "taking" may be temporary, by virtue of the government's power to rescind or amend the regulation, does not make it any less of a constitutional "taking." Nothing in the Just Compensation Clause suggests that "takings" must be permanent and irrevocable.  Nor does the temporary reversible quality of a regulatory "taking" render compensation for the time of the "taking" any less obligatory.  This Court more than once has recognized that temporary reversible "takings" should be analyzed according to the same constitutional framework applied to permanent irreversible "takings." For example, in United States v. Causby, supra, at 258-259, the United States had executed a lease to use an airport for a one-year term "ending June 30, 1942, with a provision for renewals until June 30, 1967, or six months after the end of the national emergency, whichever  the earlier." The Court held that the frequent low-level flights of Army and Navy airplanes over respondents' chicken farm, located near the airport, effected a "taking" of an easement on respondents' property.  328 U.S., at 266-267. However, because the flights could be discontinued by the Government at any time, the Court remanded the case to the Court of Claims: "Since on this record it is not clear whether the easement taken is a permanent or a temporary one, it would be premature for us to consider whether the amount of the award made by the Court of Claims was proper." Id., at 268 (emphasis added).  In other cases where the Government has taken only temporary use of a building, land, or equipment, the Court has not hesitated to determine the appropriate measure of just compensation.  See Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States, 338 U.S. 1, 6 (1949); United States v. Petty Motor Co., 327 U.S. 372, 374-375 (1946); United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U.S., at 374-375.
But contrary to appellant's claim that San Diego must formally condemn its property and pay full fair market value, nothing in the Just Compensation Clause empowers a court to order a government entity to condemn the property and pay its full fair market value, where the "taking" already effected is temporary and reversible and the government wants to halt the "taking."  Just as the government may cancel condemnation proceedings before passage of title, see 6 J. Sackman, Nichols' Law of Eminent Domain § 24.113, p. 24-21 (rev. 3d ed. 1980), or abandon property it has temporarily occupied or invaded, see United States v. Dow, 357 U.S. 17, 26 (1958), it must have the same power to rescind a regulatory "taking." As the Court has noted: " abandonment does not prejudice the property owner. It merely results in an alteration of the property interest taken -- from full ownership to one of temporary use and occupation. . . .  In such cases compensation would be measured by the principles normally governing the taking of a right to use property temporarily." Ibid.; see Danforth v. United States, 308 U.S. 271, 284 (1939).
The constitutional rule I propose requires that, once a court finds that a police power regulation has effected a "taking," the government entity must pay just compensation for the period commencing on the date the regulation first effected the "taking," and ending on the date the government entity chooses to rescind or otherwise amend the regulation. 24 Ordinary principles determining the proper measure of just compensation, regularly applied in cases of permanent and temporary "takings" involving formal condemnation proceedings, occupations, and physical invasions, should provide guidance to the courts in the award of compensation for a regulatory "taking." As a starting point, the value of the property taken may be ascertained as of the date of the "taking." United States v. Clarke, 445 U.S., at 258; Almota Farmers Elevator & Warehouse Co. v. United States, supra, at 474; United States v. Miller, 317 U.S. 369, 374 (1943); Olson v. United States, 292 U.S. 246, 255 (1934). The government must inform the court of its intentions vis-a-vis the regulation with sufficient clarity to guarantee a correct assessment of the just compensation award.  Should the government decide immediately to revoke or otherwise amend the regulation, it would be liable for payment of compensation only for the interim during which the regulation effected a "taking." 25 Rules of valuation already developed for temporary "takings" may be particularly useful to the courts in their quest for assessing the proper measure of monetary relief in cases of revocation or amendment, see generally Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States, supra; United States v. Petty Motor Co., supra; United States v. General Motors Corp., supra, although additional rules may need to be developed, see Kimball Laundry Co. v. United States, supra, at 21-22 (Rutledge, J., concurring); United States v. Miller, supra, at 373-374. Alternatively the government may choose formally to condemn the property, or otherwise to continue the offending regulation: in either case the action must be sustained by proper measures of just compensation.  See generally United States v. Fuller, 409 U.S. 488, 490-492 (1973); United States ex rel. TVA v. Powelson, 319 U.S. 266, 281-285 (1943).
It should be noted that the Constitution does not embody any specific procedure or form of remedy that the States must adopt: "The Fifth Amendment expresses a principle of fairness and not a technical rule of procedure enshrining old or new niceties regarding 'causes of action' -- when they are born, whether they proliferate, and when they die." United States v. Dickinson, 331 U.S., at 748. Cf.  United States v. Memphis Cotton Oil Co., 288 U.S. 62, 67-69 (1933). The States should be free to experiment in the implementation of this rule, provided that their chosen procedures and remedies comport with the fundamental constitutional command.  See generally Hill, The Bill of Rights and the Supervisory Power, 69 Colum. L. Rev. 181, 191-193 (1969). The only constitutional requirement is that the landowner must be able meaningfully to challenge a regulation that allegedly effects a "taking," and recover just compensation if it does so.  He may not be forced to resort to piecemeal litigation or otherwise unfair procedures in order to receive his due.  See United States v. Dickinson, supra, at 749.

In Agins v. City of Tiburon, 24 Cal. 3d, at 275, 598 P. 2d, at 29, the California Supreme Court was "persuaded by various policy considerations to the view that inverse condemnation is an inappropriate and undesirable remedy in cases in which unconstitutional regulation is alleged." In particular, the court cited "the need for preserving a degree of freedom in land-use planning function, and the inhibiting financial force which inheres in the inverse condemnation remedy," in reaching its conclusion.  Id., at 276, 598 P. 2d, at 31. But the applicability of express constitutional guarantees is not a matter to be determined on the basis of policy judgments made by the legislative, executive, or judicial branches. 26 Nor can the vindication of those rights depend on the expense in doing so.  See Watson v. Memphis, 373 U.S. 526, 537-538 (1963).
Because I believe that the Just Compensation Clause requires the constitutional rule outlined supra, I would vacate the judgment of the California Court of Appeal, Fourth District, and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. 27
