OPINION
Petitioner, an inmate of the Illinois State Penitentiary, asks us to review an order dismissing his civil rights action against the respondent corrections officers and directing him to pay counsel fees of $ 400 for services rendered by the Attorney General of Illinois in representing the respondents in that action.
After granting a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a constitutional violation, the District Court ordered petitioner to show cause why fees of $ 400 should not be taxed against him under 42 U. S. C. ยง 1988. Because he did not respond to that order, the fee award was entered. 1 A motion to reconsider was later denied on the ground that petitioner's suit was "meritless." 2 The Court of Appeals disposed of the novel question presented by petitioner by affirming the fee award in an unpublished order. 3 We now grant the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for certiorari and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
I
On September 20, 1977, petitioner was charged with a violation of prison regulations and placed in segregation. At a disciplinary hearing two days later, petitioner admitted that he and two other inmates had consumed a homemade alcoholic beverage; his punishment was confinement to segregation for 10 days, 4   demotion to C-grade, and loss of 30 days' statutory good time.
Petitioner exhausted his administrative remedies and then filed a complaint under 42 U. S. C. ยง 1983 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on the form used by prisoners who are not represented by counsel.  The facts stated on the form raised two federal questions of arguable merit: (1) the decision to place petitioner in a segregation cell on September 20, 1977, was not preceded by a hearing and was not justified by any emergency or other necessity; (2) two of the officers who conducted the disciplinary hearing after petitioner had been in segregation for two days were biased against him. 5 Respondents, represented by the State Attorney General's Office, moved to dismiss the complaint, but filed no affidavits denying or explaining the facts alleged by petitioner.  After allowing petitioner to file various amendments and additional papers, the District Court dismissed the complaint without taking any evidence.  Thereafter the fee award was made.
In its order affirming the action of the District Court, the Court of Appeals correctly noted that   the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment affords a prisoner certain minimum procedural safeguards before disciplinary action may be taken against him. 6 Because the record did   not reveal a violation of those safeguards at the hearing on September 22, the Court of Appeals concluded that the complaint had been properly dismissed.  However, the Court of Appeals seems to have overlooked the fact, clearly stated in petitioner's brief on appeal, that the disciplinary hearing did not take place until two days after petitioner was placed in segregation on September 20.  Nothing in the papers filed on behalf of the respondents purports to justify or explain the segregation of petitioner for two days in advance of the disciplinary hearing.
II
Petitioner's complaint, like most prisoner complaints filed in the Northern District of Illinois, was not prepared by counsel.  It is settled law that the allegations of such a complaint, "however inartfully pleaded" are held "to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers . . . ." Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972).See also Maclin v. Paulson, 627 F.2d 83, 86 (CA7 1980); French v. Heyne, 547 F.2d 994, 996 (CA7 1976). Such a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief. Haines, supra, at 520-521. 7 And, of course, the allegations of the complaint are generally taken as true for purposes of a motion to dismiss. Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 322 (1972).
Applying these principles to petitioner's amended complaint, we conclude that all but one of its allegations were properly dismissed for failure to state a claim. Petitioner's allegations of bias and procedural irregularities in the September 22 hearing, unequal treatment, and cruel and unusual punishment, even when liberally construed, were insufficient to require any further proceedings in the District Court.  We therefore affirm the dismissal of these claims.
Petitioner's allegation that he had been confined unnecessarily to segregation is of a different character.  It can be construed as a contention that his confinement to segregation violated due process because it took place without a prior hearing. It is clear from the facts alleged in the amended complaint that petitioner was confined in segregation for two days before a hearing was held. Indeed, petitioner expressly stated this claim in procedural due process terms in his response to the defendants' motion to dismiss the amended complaint. 8
Segregation of a prisoner without a prior hearing may violate due process if the postponement of procedural protections is not justified by apprehended emergency conditions.  See Hayes v. Walker, 555 F.2d 625, 633 (CA7), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 959 (1977). The amended complaint alleged that segregation was unnecessary in petitioner's case because his offense did not involve violence and he did not present a "clear and present danger." There is no suggestion in the record that immediate segregation was necessitated by emergency conditions.  Defendants did make the unsworn assertion that petitioner was placed in segregation on "temporary investigative status," 9 but the significance of this designation is unclear and it does not, without more, dispose of petitioner's procedural due process claim.  The District Court, in dismissing the amended complaint, merely concluded that temporary segregation pending investigation was not actionable. 10 The court cited an Illinois Department of Corrections Administrative Regulation which authorized segregation of prisoners pending investigation of disciplinary matters,  where required "in the interest of institutional security and safety." 11 In the absence of any showing that concern for institutional security and safety was the basis for immediate segregation of petitioner without a prior hearing, this regulation does not justify dismissal of petitioner's suit for failure to state a claim.
Our discussion of this claim is not intended to express any view on its merits.  We conclude merely that the amended complaint was adequate at least to require some response from the defendants, by way of affidavit or otherwise, to petitioner's claim that he was unjustifiably placed in segregation without a prior hearing. Although petitioner's pleadings are prolix and lacking in stylistic precision, this is not a case like Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976),  in which a pro se litigant's detailed recitation of the facts reveals on its face the insufficiency of the complaint.  We cannot say with assurance that petitioner can prove no set of facts in support of his claim entitling him to relief.  Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S., at 521. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals should have reversed the dismissal of this claim and remanded for further proceedings. 12
III
The award of attorney's fees entered against petitioner must be vacated.
In Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412 (1978), we held that the defendant in an action brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 may recover attorney's fees from the plaintiff only if the District Court finds "that the plaintiff's action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith." Id., at 421. Although arguably a different standard might be applied in a civil rights action under 42 U. S. C. ยง 1983, we can perceive no reason for applying a less stringent standard.  The plaintiff's action must be meritless in the sense that it is groundless or without foundation.  The fact that a plaintiff may ultimately lose his case is not in itself a sufficient justification for the assessment of fees.  As we stated in Christiansburg:
"
To take the further step of assessing attorney's fees against plaintiffs simply because they do not finally prevail would substantially add to the risks inhering in most litigation and would undercut the efforts of Congress to promote the vigorous enforcement of the provisions of Title VII.  Hence,   a plaintiff should not be assessed his opponent's attorney's fees unless a court finds that his claim was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless, or that the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so." 434 U.S., at 422.
No such finding supported the fee award in this case.
These limitations apply with special force in actions initiated by uncounseled prisoners. Faithful adherence to the principles of Haines v. Kerner dictates that attorney's fees should rarely be awarded against such plaintiffs.  The fact that a prisoner's complaint, even when liberally construed, cannot survive a motion to dismiss does not, without more, entitle the defendant to attorney's fees.  An unrepresented litigant should not be punished for his failure to recognize subtle factual or legal deficiencies in his claims.  As the Court noted in Christiansburg, even if the law or the facts are somewhat questionable or unfavorable at the outset of litigation, a party may have an entirely reasonable ground for bringing suit.  434 U.S., at 422.
Despite the lower court's conclusion to the contrary, the allegations of petitioner's amended complaint are definitely not meritless in the Christiansburg sense.  Even those allegations that were properly dismissed for failure to state a claim deserved and received the careful consideration of both the District Court and the Court of Appeals. 13 Allegations that,   upon careful examination, prove legally insufficient to require a trial are not, for that reason alone, "groundless" or "without foundation" as required by Christiansburg.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
It is so ordered.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE would grant the petition and set the case for oral argument.
JUSTICE STEWART would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals insofar as it affirmed the District Court's dismissal of the petitioner's complaint.  He substantially agrees, however, with what is said in Part III of the Court's per curiam opinion, and for those reasons would reverse the judgment insofar as it affirmed the award of attorney's fees entered against the petitioner.
CONCUR BY: WHITE (In Part)
JUSTICE WHITE, concurring in part and concurring in the result.
I agree with the result reached in Part II of the per curiam opinion.  Under Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974), a prior hearing was required for the particular disciplinary action involved here -- segregation and loss of good time.  But as Wolff makes clear, Fourteenth Amendment procedural protections were triggered only because under state law -- here prison regulations -- segregation and good-time reductions could be  imposed only for serious disciplinary lapses and only after a prior hearing. 1 Under these regulations, segregation prior to a hearing could occur only for reasons of prison security and safety. 2 I agree that there have been no findings that warranted dispensing with the prior hearing.
It is well to point out, however, that although petitioner sought compensatory and punitive damages, as well as declaratory relief, he had a full hearing within 48 hours of his confinement, his guilt was properly established (indeed, he admitted his conduct as he had before), and the discipline imposed on him was found to be justified.  Even if petitioner is successful in proving a due process deprivation, his damages would be limited to those flowing from postponement of a hearing for two days.  Under Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247 (1978), it is likely that only nominal damages would be awardable.
I am in accord with Part III of the Court's opinion.
DISSENT BY: REHNQUIST
JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting.
In its effort to distill some vaguely tenable claim from petitioner's complaint, the Court ignores crucial admissions in the complaint itself which fatally undermine any claim of constitutional deprivation. As I read the Court opinion, it holds that the District Court erred in dismissing petitioner's complaint solely because the complaint can be construed to allege that petitioner was placed in segregation without a prior hearing, although he was given an adequate hearing before a review board 40 hours later.  The Court recognizes that petitioner admitted before the review board that he violated prison regulations by consuming homemade alcohol, ante, at 7-8, but fails to recognize that he had also admitted his guilt at the time of the incident.  In his amended complaint petitioner alleged:
" was placed in segregation unnecessarily on September 20, 1977, because there was no violence involved, and I was not a 'clear and present' danger. Additionally, I had admitted to Captain C. D. Tuttle that I had been drinking." Amended Complaint 13. 1
The complaint also reveals that petitioner has "a problem with alcohol." Id., at 14. 2 In light of these admissions it is difficult to see what purpose the hearing which the Court rules may have been constitutionally required would have served.  The hearing would not be held to determine if petitioner violated prison regulations; he admitted that he had when apprehended.  Nor would the hearing be held to determine appropriate punishment.  That hearing, before the review board, was held 40 hours later, and the Court concedes that no matter how liberally petitioner's complaint is construed it does not state any claim concerning the conduct of that hearing or the punishment.  Ante, at 10. The sole purpose the hearing could have served would be to determine if petitioner should have been removed from the general prison population for the short period between the occurrence of the incident at 7:30 the night of September 20 and the review board hearing held before noon on September 22.
In light of the facts admitted by petitioner, however, it is clear that he cannot state a claim against the prison officials for not holding such a hearing.  The reports of the conduct of which petitioner admitted being guilty described his condition as "tipsy, speech slurred" and stated that petitioner "had all the appearance of being drunk" and "appeared to be intoxicated." In his grievance filed on September 24 petitioner again admitted that he had gotten "drunk" the night of the 20th.3 Intoxicated inmates surely pose a serious threat to prison security and safety, and the placing of petitioner in temporary investigative status was authorized by a prison regulation providing for such action "in the interest of institutional security and safety." This Court has on several occasions stressed that "'central to all other corrections goals is the institutional consideration of internal security within corrections facilities themselves.'" Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 546-547 (1979) (quoting Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 823 (1974)). See Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, 433 U.S. 119, 129 (1977); Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S.  396, 412 (1974).  "Prison officials must be free to take appropriate action to ensure the safety of inmates and corrections personnel . . . ." Bell v. Wolfish, supra, at 547. This Court has also repeatedly recognized that the judiciary, "ill-equipped" to deal with "complex and difficult" problems of running a prison, must accord the decisions of prison officials great deference.  See, e. g., Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, supra, at 126; Procunier v. Martinez, supra, at 405. This rule applies with its greatest force when prison officials act to preserve the central goal of institutional discipline.  "Prison administrators . . . should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security." Bell v. Wolfish, supra, at 547. Against this well-established background, and with petitioner's admitted violation of prison regulations by consuming homemade alcohol, it is clear that the prison officials acted within their discretion in removing petitioner from the general prison population. Even the Court of Appeals authority relied upon by the Court recognized that claims such as the present one must be based on allegations of "bad faith" or "mere pretext." Hayes v. Walker, 555 F.2d 625, 633 (CA7 1977) (quoting La Batt v. Twomey, 513 F.2d 641, 647 (CA7 1975)). Because petitioner has admitted to being intoxicated, however, it is clear that he cannot claim   the prison officials acted out of bad faith or on mere pretext.  Their   decision to remove him from the general prison population was "rationally related to the reasonable, indeed to the central, objectives of prison administration," Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, supra, at 129.
Indeed, it is difficult to envision exactly how an intoxicated inmate would participate in any meaningful way in a hearing held immediately after the drinking incident.  A strong argument could certainly be advanced that it would have been a violation of petitioner's rights to hold a hearing when he was, as he admitted, drunk.
This case is thus like Codd v. Velger, 429 U.S. 624 (1977), where we held that no constitutional violation occurred when an untenured employee was discharged without a hearing.  No hearing was required to permit the employee to clear his name, since he did not dispute the truth of the allegedly stigmatizing reason for the discharge.  Here the case is even stronger, since petitioner not only does not contend he was innocent of any violation but also admitted his guilt at the time of the incident.  In Codd no hearing was required on whether the discharge was justified in light of the employee's conduct because the employee had no property interest in continued employment.  So, too, here no hearing was required on whether removal from the general prison population pending convening of the review board was justified, since this decision is within the discretion of prison officials and, in view of petitioner's admissions, no abuse of discretion can be shown. 4
Even if petitioner had not represented a threat to prison security himself, his removal from the general prison population for a brief period 5 was fully justified in order to protect the integrity of the later hearing before the review board. Permitting inmates to return to the general prison population following a serious breach of prison discipline or violation of prison rules poses difficulties in terms of alibi construction and witness intimidation.  The problems were certainly present in this case, where one of three inmates involved in a single incident admitted the charges but the other two denied them.  The argument that such investigative justifications cannot outweigh the burden imposed on an innocent or possibly innocent inmate, whatever its merit in other cases, is of course not applicable in this case where petitioner has admitted and continues to admit his guilt.
Nothing in the foregoing detracts from the rule of Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519 (1972), concerning the liberality with which pro se inmate complaints are to be read, since the complaint itself contains the admission of guilt which undermines any colorable claim.  I would also note that petitioner filed his original and amended complaints on forms designed to make it easier for pro se inmates to articulate their claims.  Such forms should make the problem of Haines v. Kerner recur less frequently by isolating the relevant information for the district court judge.  The Court notes that the District Court gave petitioner's complaint "   careful consideration," and Judge Swygert below argued that "it is quite evident from the detailed treatment given by the   to the issues . . . that the suit was not groundless or meritless." It is odd, however, to reverse a District Court for spending considerable time and effort before concluding that a complaint was meritless. The fact that the District Court carefully examined petitioner's complaint for any possible claim before dismissing it is hardly evidence that a colorable claim must exist.  Quite the contrary, it is a strong indication that no claim could be found no matter how deeply the District Court probed.
The award of attorney's fees was entirely proper in this case.  The District Court expressly found that petitioner's suit was meritless in response to respondents' motion, which was based on Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412 (1978), and cited that case extensively.  It is clear, therefore, that the District Court was using "meritless" as that term was understood in Christiansburg, supra, at 421 ("the term 'meritless' is to be understood as meaning groundless or without foundation, rather than simply that the plaintiff has ultimately lost his case").
The decision whether to award attorney's fees under 42 U. S. C. ยง 1988 is committed to the discretion of the district courts, who are intimately familiar with the course of the litigation.  Like the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, I cannot say that the District Court abused its discretion in awarding attorney's fees in this case.  In light of petitioner's own admissions it was clear from the outset that he could state no cognizable claim.  This is not a case, such as was suggested in Christiansburg, supra, at 422, where the claim appeared meritorious at the outset and only later was refuted by facts which emerged on discovery or at trial.  The decisive facts were stated in the complaint and they were not merely "questionable" or "unfavorable," as the Court suggests, ante, at 15; they were dispositive.
