OPINION
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.
Wheaton-Haven Recreation Association, Inc., a nonprofit Maryland corporation, was organized in 1958 for the purpose of operating a swimming pool. After a membership drive to raise funds, the Association obtained zoning as a "community pool" and constructed its facility near Silver Spring, Maryland.  The Association is essentially a single-function recreational club, furnishing only swimming and related amenities. 1
Membership is by family units, rather than individuals, and is limited to 325 families. 2 This limit has been reached on at least one occasion.  Membership is largely keyed to the geographical area within a three-quarter-mile radius of the pool. 3 A resident (whether or not a homeowner) of that area requires no recommendation before he may apply for membership; the resident receives a preferential place on the waiting list if he applies when the membership is full; and the resident-member who is a homeowner and who sells his home and turns in his membership, confers on the purchaser of his property a first option on the vacancy created by his removal and resignation.  A person   residing outside the three-quarter-mile area may apply for membership only upon the recommendation of a member; he receives no preferential place on the waiting list if the membership is full; and if he becomes a member, he has no way of conferring an option upon the purchaser of his property. Beyond-the-area members may not exceed 30% of the total.  Majority approval of those present at a meeting of the board of directors or of the general membership is required before an applicant is admitted as a member.
Only members and their guests are admitted to the pool. No one else may gain admission merely by payment of an entrance fee.
In the spring of 1968 petitioner, Harry C. Press, a Negro who had purchased from a nonmember a home within the geographical preference area, inquired about   membership in Wheaton-Haven.  At that time the Association had no Negro member.  In November 1968 the general membership rejected a resolution that would have opened the way for Negro members.  Dr. Press was never given an application form, and respondents concede that he was discouraged from applying because of his race.
In July 1968 petitioners Murray and Rosalind N. Tillman, who were husband and wife and members in good standing, brought petitioner Grace Rosner, a Negro, to the pool as their guest. Although Mrs. Rosner was admitted on that occasion, the guest policy was changed by the board of directors, at a special meeting the following day, to limit guests to relatives of members.  Respondents concede that one reason for the adoption of this policy was to prevent members from having Negroes as guests at the pool. Under this new policy Mrs. Rosner thereafter was refused admission when the Tillmans sought to have her as their guest. In the fall of 1968 the membership, by resolution, reaffirmed the policy.
In October 1969 petitioners (Mr. and Mrs. Tillman, Dr. and Mrs. Press, and Mrs. Rosner) instituted this civil action against the Association and individuals who were its officers or directors, seeking damages and declaratory and injunctive relief, particularly under the Civil Rights Act of 1866, now 42 U. S. C. § 1982, 4 the Civil Rights Act of 1870, now 42 U. S. C. § 1981, and Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 243, 42 U. S. C. § 2000a, et seq.  The District Court, in an unreported opinion, held that Wheaton-Haven was a private club and exempt from the nondiscrimination provisions of the statutes.  It granted summary judgment for defendants.  The Court of Appeals affirmed, one judge dissenting.   451 F.2d 1211 (CA4 1971). It later denied rehearing en banc over two dissents,  id., at 1225. We granted certiorari,  406 U.S. 916 (1972), to review the case in the light of  Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, 396 U.S. 229 (1969).
I
In  Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409 (1968), this Court, after a detailed review of the legislative history of 42 U. S. C. § 1982,  id., at 422-437, held that the statute   reaches beyond state action and is not confined to officially sanctioned segregation.  The Court subsequently applied § 1982 in Sullivan to private racial discrimination practiced by a nonstock corporation organized to operate a community park and playground facilities, including a swimming pool, for residents of a designated area.  The Presses contend that their § 1982 claim is controlled by Sullivan.  We agree.
A. The Court of Appeals held that § 1982 would not apply to the Presses because membership rights in Wheaton-Haven could neither be leased nor transferred incident to the acquisition of property.   451 F.2d, at 1216-1217.In Sullivan, the Court concluded that the right to enjoy a membership share in the corporation, assigned by a property owner as part of a leasehold he was granting, constituted a right "to . . . lease . . . property" protected by § 1982.   396 U.S., at 236-237. The Court of Appeals distinguished property-linked membership shares in Sullivan from property-linked membership preferences in Wheaton-Haven by emphasizing the speculative nature of the benefits available to residents of the area around Wheaton-Haven.  We conclude that the Court of Appeals erroneously characterized the property-linked preferences conferred by Wheaton-Haven's bylaws.
Under the bylaws, a resident of the area within three-quarters of a mile from the pool receives the three preferences noted above: he is allowed to apply for membership without seeking a recommendation from a current member; he receives preference over others, except those with first options, when applying for a membership vacancy; and, if he is an owner-member, he is able to pass to his successor-in-title a first option to acquire the membership Wheaton-Haven purchases from him. 5 If the membership is full, the preference-area resident is placed on the waiting list; other applicants, however, are required to reapply after those on the waiting list obtain memberships.
The Court of Appeals concluded, incorrectly it later appeared, that the membership had never been full, 6 and that the option possibility, therefore, was "far too tenuous a thread to support a conclusion that there is a transfer of membership incident to the purchase of property."  451 F.2d, at 1217. Since the Presses had not purchased their area home from a member, the court found no transaction by which the Presses could have acquired a membership   preference.   451 F.2d, at 1217-1218, n. 14.
We differ from the Court of Appeals in our evaluation of the three rights obtained.  The record indicates that the membership was full in the   spring of 1968 but dropped, perhaps not unexpectedly in view of the season, in the fall of that year.  We cannot be certain, either, that the membership would not have remained full in the absence of racial discrimination, 7 or that the membership will never be full in the future.  As was observed in dissent in the Court of Appeals:
"Several years from now it may well be that a white neighbor can sell his home at a considerably higher price than Dr. and Mrs. Press because the white owner will be able to assure his purchaser of an option for membership in Wheaton-Haven.  Dr. and Mrs. Press, however, are denied this advantage."  451 F.2d, at 1223.
Similarly, the automatic waiting-list preference given to residents of the favored area may have affected the price paid by the Presses when they bought their home.  Thus, the purchase price to them, like the rental paid by Freeman in Sullivan, may well reflect benefits dependent on residency in the preference area.  For them, however, the right to acquire a home in the area is abridged and diluted.
When an organization links membership benefits to residency in a narrow geographical area, that decision infuses those benefits into the bundle of rights for which an individual pays when buying or leasing within the area.  The mandate of 42 U. S. C. § 1982 then operates to guarantee a nonwhite resident, who purchases, leases, or holds this property, the same rights as are enjoyed by a white resident.
B.  Respondents contend that even if 42 U. S. C. § 1982 applies, Wheaton-Haven nevertheless is exempt as a private club under § 201 (e) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. § 2000a (e), 8 with a consequent implied narrowing effect upon the range and application of the older § 1982.  In Sullivan we found it unnecessary to consider limits on § 1982 as applied to a truly private association because we found "no plan or purpose of exclusiveness"  in Little Hunting Park.   396 U.S., at 236.But here, as there, membership "is open to every white person within the geographic area, there being no selective element other than race." Ibid.  The only restrictions are the stated maximum number of memberships and, as in Sullivan,  id., at 234, the requirement of formal board or membership approval.  The structure and practices of Wheaton-Haven thus are indistinguishable from those of Little Hunting Park. 9 We hold, as a consequence, that Wheaton-Haven is not a private club and that it is not necessary in this case to consider the issue of any implied limitation on the sweep of § 1982 when its application to a truly private club, within the meaning of § 2000a (e), is under consideration.  Cf. Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163 (1972);  Daniel v. Paul, 395 U.S. 298 (1969).
II
Mrs. Rosner and the Tillmans, relying on 42 U. S. C. §§ 1981, 10 1982, and 2000a et seq., contend that Wheaton-Haven could not adopt a racially discriminatory policy toward guests. The District Court granted summary judgment for the respondents on these claims also, holding that Wheaton-Haven was a private club and exempt from all three statutes.
The operative language of both § 1981 and § 1982 is traceable to the Act of April 9, 1866, c. 31, § 1, 14 Stat. 27.   Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U.S. 24, 30-31 n. 7 (1948).11   In light of the historical interrelationship between § 1981 and § 1982, we see no reason to construe these sections differently when applied, on these facts, to the claim of Wheaton-Haven that it is a private club. Consequently, our discussion and rejection of Wheaton-Haven's claim that it is exempt from § 1982 disposes of the argument that Wheaton-Haven is exempt from § 1981.  On remand the District Court will develop any necessary facts concerning the adoption of the guest policy and will evaluate the claims of the parties 12 free of the misconception that Wheaton-Haven is exempt from §§ 1981, 1982, and 2000a.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.
It is so ordered.
