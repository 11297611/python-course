PER CURIAM.
The motion to strike the supplemental brief on behalf of the respondent is denied.  The judgment is reversed.  Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505; Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23.
MR. JUSTICE CLARK, concurring: Since the Court finds that the "spiked" mike used by the police officers penetrated petitioner's premises sufficiently to be an actual trespass thereof, I join in the judgment.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE dissents.
