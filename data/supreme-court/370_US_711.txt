OPINION
Reversed.  Sinclair Rfg. Co. v. Atkinson, ante, p. 195.
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER took no part in the decision of this case.
MR. JUSTICE WHITE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
CONCUR BY: BRENNAN
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN join, concurring.
Since it is clear that the collective bargaining agreement involved in  this case does not bind either party to arbitrate any dispute, I agree that no injunction should be granted. * See Sinclair Rfg. Co. v. Atkinson, ante, p. 215 (dissenting opinion).
