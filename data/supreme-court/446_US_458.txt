OPINION
Mr. JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question is whether the trustees of a business trust may invoke the diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts on the basis   of their own citizenship, rather than that of the trust's beneficial shareholders.
I
The respondents are eight individual trustees of Fidelity Mortgage Investors, a business trust organized under Massachusetts law. 1 They hold title to real estate investments in trust for the benefit of Fidelity's shareholders. 2 The declaration of trust gives the respondents exclusive authority over this property "free from any power and control of the Shareholders, to the same extent as if the Trustees were the sole owners of the Trust Estate in their own right. . . ." 3 The respondents have power to transact Fidelity's business, execute documents, and "sue and be sued in the name of the Trust or in their names as Trustees of the Trust." 4 They may  invest the funds of the trust, lend money, and initiate or compromise lawsuits relating to the trust's affairs. 5
In 1971, respondents lent $ 850,000 to a Texas firm in return for a promissory note payable to themselves as trustees.  The note was secured in part by a commitment letter in which petitioner Navarro Savings Association agreed to lend the Texas firm $ 850,000 to cover its obligation to the respondents.  In 1973, respondents called upon Navarro to make the "takeout" loan.  Navarro refused, and this action followed.  The amended complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, sought approximately $ 175,000 in damages for breach of contract.  Federal jurisdiction was premised upon diversity of citizenship. 28 U. S. C. § 1332. 6 The complaint asserted -- and the parties agree -- that Navarro was a Texas citizen and that each respondent was a citizen of another State.  The parties have stipulated, however, that some of Fidelity's beneficial shareholders were Texas residents.
The District Court dismissed the action for want of subject-matter jurisdiction.  416 F.Supp. 1186 (1976). Concluding that a business trust is a citizen of every State in which its shareholders reside, the court held that the parties lacked the complete diversity required by Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 3 Cranch 267 (1806). The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed.  597 F.2d 421 (1979). It held that the respondent trustees were real parties in interest because they had full power to manage and control the trust and to sue on its behalf.  Since complete diversity existed among the actual parties to the controversy, the Court of Appeals directed the District Court to proceed to trial on the merits.  We granted certiorari, 444 U.S. 962 (1979), and we now affirm.
II
Federal courts have jurisdiction over controversies between "Citizens of different States" by virtue of 28 U. S. C. § 1332 (a)(1) and U.S. Const., Art. III, § 2.  Early in its history, this Court established that the "citizens" upon whose diversity a plaintiff grounds jurisdiction must be real and substantial parties to the controversy. McNutt v. Bland, 2 How. 9, 15 (1844); see Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 16 How. 314, 328-329 (1854);Coal Co. v. Blatchford, 11 Wall. 172, 177 (1871).  Thus, a federal court must disregard nominal or formal parties and rest jurisdiction only upon the citizenship of real parties to the controversy.  E. g., McNutt v. Bland, supra, at 14; see 6 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1556, pp. 710-711 (1971).
The early cases held that   only persons could be real parties to the controversy.  Artificial or "invisible" legal creatures were not citizens of any State.  Bank of United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 86-87, 91 (1809). 7 Although corporations suing in diversity long have been "deemed" citizens, see n. 7, supra, unincorporated associations remain mere collections of individuals.  When the "persons composing such association" sue in their collective name, they are the parties whose citizenship determines the diversity jurisdiction of a federal court.  Great Southern Fire Proof Hotel Co. v. Jones, 177 U.S. 449, 456 (1900)  (limited partnership association); see Steelworkers v. Bouligny, Inc., 382 U.S. 145 (1965) (labor union); Chapman v. Barney, 129 U.S. 677 (1889) (joint stock company).
Navarro contends that Fidelity's trust form masks an unincorporated association of individuals who make joint real estate investments.  Navarro observes that certain features of the trust's operations also characterize the operations of an association: centralized management, continuity of enterprise, and unlimited duration.  Arguing that this trust is in substance an association, Navarro reasons that the real parties to the lawsuit are Fidelity's beneficial shareholders.
III
We need not reject the argument that Fidelity shares some attributes of an association.  In certain respects, a business trust also resembles a corporation.  But this case involves neither an association nor a corporation. Fidelity is an express trust, and the question is whether its trustees are real parties to this controversy for purposes of a federal court's diversity jurisdiction. 8
As early as 1808, this Court stated that  trustees of an express trust are entitled to bring diversity actions in their own names and upon the basis of their own citizenship. Chappedelaine v. Dechenaux, 4 Cranch 306, 308.Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17 (a) now provides that such trustees are real parties in interest for procedural purposes. 9 Yet   similar principles governed diversity jurisdiction long before the advent of uniform rules of procedure. 10 In 1870, the Court declared that jurisdiction properly founded upon the diverse citizenship of individual trustees "is not defeated by the fact that the parties whom they represent may be disqualified." Coal Co. v. Blatchford, 11 Wall., at 175 (mortgage contract).  " residence of those who may have the equitable interest" is simply irrelevant.  Bonnafee v. Williams, 3 How. 574, 577 (1845) (note held in trust for third party).  The same rule applies when "the beneficiaries are many." Dodge v. Tulleys, 144 U.S. 451, 456 (1892) (dictum) (railroad trust deed). 11
In Bullard v. Cisco, 290 U.S. 179, 189 (1933), the trust beneficiaries were "numerous and widely scattered" investors who had conveyed certain bonds to a committee formed by a protective agreement.  The agreement did not use trust terminology.  Nevertheless, the Court held that the "rights, powers and duties expressly assigned" to committee members "necessarily" made them trustees.  Ibid.  The agreement gave the committeemen "full title to the deposited bonds," and it defined "the control and power of disposal which the trustees were to have over them." Ibid.  Refusing to analogize the committee to a collection agency, the Court concluded that " beneficiaries were not necessary parties and their citizenship was immaterial." Id., at 190. 12
Bullard reaffirms that a trustee is a real party to the controversy for purposes of diversity jurisdiction when he possesses certain customary powers to hold, manage, and dispose of assets for the benefit of others. 13 The trustees in this case have such powers. At all relevant times, Fidelity operated under a declaration of trust that authorized the trustees to take legal title to trust assets, to invest those assets for the benefit of the shareholders, and to sue and be sued in their capacity as trustees.  Respondents filed this lawsuit in that capacity.  They seek damages for breach of an obligation running to the holder of a promissory note held in their own names.  Fidelity's 9,500 beneficial shareholders had no voice in the initial investment decision.  They can neither   control the disposition of this action nor intervene in the affairs of the trust except in the most extraordinary situations. 14
We conclude that these respondents are active trustees whose control over the assets held in their names is real and substantial.  That the trust may depart from conventional forms in other respects has no bearing upon this determination.  Nor does Fidelity's resemblance to a business enterprise alter the distinctive rights and duties of the trustees. 15 There is no allegation of sham or collusion.  See 28 U. S. C. § 1359; Bullard v. Cisco, supra, at 187-188, and n. 5. The respondents are not "naked trustees" who act as "mere conduits" for a remedy flowing to others.  McNutt v. Bland, 2 How., at 13-14; see Browne v. Strode, 5 Cranch 303 (1809). They have legal title; they manage the assets; they control the litigation.  In short, they are real parties to the controversy.  For more than 150 years, the law has permitted   trustees who meet this standard to sue in their own right, without regard to the citizenship of the trust beneficiaries. We find no reason to forsake that principle today.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
Affirmed.

DISSENT BY: BLACKMUN
MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, dissenting.
A reader of the Court's conclusory opinion might wonder why this heavily burdened tribunal chose to review this case.  Most assuredly, we did not do so merely to reaffirm, ante, at 462, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall's ruling from the bench in Chappedelaine v. Dechenaux, 4 Cranch 306, 308 (1808), to the effect that aliens serving respectively as residuary legatee and representative of an estate, "although they sue as trustees," were entitled to bring a federal diversity action against a Georgia citizen.  Rather, I had thought that we granted certiorari to resolve a significant conflict among the Courts of Appeals concerning the question whether the citizenship of a business trust, for purposes of establishing diversity jurisdiction, is determined by looking to the citizenship of its trustees or that of its beneficial shareholders. 1 I believe that the analysis applied by the Court of Appeals in resolving that question was correct, but in applying that same analysis I would reach a different result.  I feel that neither the approach now used by this Court, nor the result it reaches, comports with the Massachusetts law of business trusts, or with the Court's precedents concerning diversity jurisdiction.
I
The Court recognizes that Fidelity Mortgage Investors, a Massachusetts business trust, "shares some attributes of an association," and that it "also resembles a corporation." Ante, at 462.  The Court concludes, however, based on its reading of portions of Fidelity's Declaration of Trust, that it is an "express trust." Taken either as a proposition of the general common-law of trusts, 2 or as an interpretation of the Massachusetts law of business trusts, that conclusion is not nearly so automatic and evident as the Court's scant reasoning implies.
In Hecht v. Malley, 265 U.S. 144 (1924), this Court described the Massachusetts business trust in terms that have
come to be accepted as the classic definition, see 16A R. Eickhoff, Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations § 8228 (1979):
"The 'Massachusetts Trust' is a form of business organization, common in that State, consisting essentially of an arrangement whereby property is conveyed to trustees, in accordance with the terms of an instrument of trust, to be held and managed for the benefit of such persons as may from time to time be the holders of transferable certificates issued by the trustees showing the shares into which the beneficial interest in the property is divided.  These certificates, which resemble certificates for shares of stock in a corporation and are issued and transferred in like manner, entitle the holders to share ratably in the income of the property, and, upon termination of the trust, in the proceeds.
"Under the Massachusetts decisions these trust instruments are held to create either pure trusts or partnerships, according to the way in which the trustees are to conduct the affairs committed to their charge.  If they are the principals and are free from the control of the certificate holders in the management of the property, a trust is created; but if the certificate holders are associated together in the control of the property as principals and the trustees are merely their managing agents, a partnership relation between the certificate holders is created.  Williams v. Milton, 215 Mass. 1, 6; Frost v. Thompson, 219 Mass. 360, 365; Dana v. Treasurer, 227 Mass. 562, 565;   Priestley v. Treasurer, 230 Mass. 452, 455.
"These trusts -- whether pure trusts or partnerships -- are unincorporated. They are not organized under any statute; and they derive no power, benefit or privilege from any statute.  The Massachusetts statutes, however, recognize their existence and impose upon them, as 'associations,' certain obligations and liabilities." (Footnotes omitted.) 3 265 U.S., at 146-147.
Based on its reading of Fidelity's Fifth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, App. A40, and seemingly unconcerned with considerations of state law, the Court determines that respondents "are active trustees whose control over the assets held in their names is real and substantial." Ante, at 465.  That the trustees' control over the assets of Fidelity is substantial may be accepted without quarrel.  The Court fails to recognize, however, that the Declaration of Trust lodges in the beneficial shareholders substantial control over the actions of these trustees.  Article 2.1 of the Declaration provides that the trustees are to be elected at annual shareholder meetings by a majority of the shares voted.  App. A47.  Article 2.2 provides that trustees may be removed from office, with or without cause, by vote of the majority of the outstanding shares.  Ibid.  Article 6.7 vests in the shareholders two significant powers: the ability to call a special meeting upon the request of not less than 20% of the outstanding shares, and the requirement that any sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of more than 50% of the trust assets is to be made only upon the affirmative approval of the holders of a majority of the shares.  Id., at A67.  Most significantly, Art. 8.2 reserves to the holders of a majority of the shares the right to terminate the trust at any shareholder meeting, and Art. 8.3 gives them the power to amend the Declaration of Trust itself.  Id., at A79-A80.
The leading Massachusetts decision concerning the legal nature of a business trust is Williams v. Inhabitants of Milton, 215 Mass. 1, 102 N. E. 355 (1913). There the court inquired whether personal property held by the trustees of the Boston Personal Property Trust was to be taxed as partnership property or investment trust property.  In concluding that the indenture of trust created a true trust, the court observed that the shareholders of the trust were not associated in any way, did not hold meetings, and could not force the trustees to amend or terminate the trust.  Id., at 10, 102 N. E., at 358. The court emphasized, however, that the parties' intent to create a trust, rather than a partnership, as evidenced in the declaration of trust, was not controlling.  "It is what the parties did in making the trust indenture that is decisive." Id., at 12, 102 N. E., at 359.
In Frost v. Thompson, 219 Mass. 360, 365, 106 N. E. 1009, 1010 (1914), the court distilled from Williams the following test:
"A declaration of trust or other instrument providing for the holding of property by trustees for the benefit of the owners of assignable certificates representing the beneficial interest in the property may create a trust or it may create a partnership. Whether it is the one or the other depends upon the way in which the trustees are to conduct the affairs committed to their charge. If they act as principals and are free from the control of the certificate holders, a trust is created; but if they are subject to the control of the certificate holders, it is a partnership."
Guided by these principles, the Frost court concluded that the "Buena Vista Fruit Company" was a partnership rather than a trust.  This conclusion followed from the fact that shareholders representing two-thirds of the outstanding shares had the power to remove any or all of the trustees at any time without cause, to appoint others to fill resulting vacancies, and to terminate the trust.  Moreover, shareholders representing a majority of the shares had the power to amend the declaration of trust and bylaws.  "These provisions demonstrate that this association is a partnership and not a trust." Id., at 366, 106 N. E., at 1010. Thus, the court concluded that the trustees could not be sued in an action on a note issued by the Buena Vista Fruit Company.
In a variety of contexts, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has continued to observe the line, drawn in Williams and in Frost, that is based on the relative powers of shareholders and trustees in a business trust. 4 It appears to me that the powers lodged in the beneficial shareholders of Fidelity -- the powers to elect and remove trustees, to vote on major trust investments, to amend the terms of the trust, and to terminate it -- clearly dictate that it falls on the partnership side of the line.  And those same powers convert the relationship between Fidelity's trustees and shareholders from one of trusteeship to one of agency.  Thus, in Williams, the court stated: "The person in whose name the partnership property stands in such a case is perhaps in a sense a trustee.  But speaking with accuracy he is an agent who for the principal's convenience holds the legal title to the principal's property." 215 Mass., at 6, 102 N. E., at 356. See also Howe v. Chmielinski, 237 Mass. 532, 534, 130 N. E. 56, 56 (1921).
I do not suggest that this state-law analysis is fully dispositive of the federal jurisdictional question presented here, see n. 7, infra, but it certainly is relevant. 5 Moreover, I believe that it casts very substantial doubt on the Court's major premise, namely, that Fidelity is an "express trust."
II
Petitioner argues that this case is controlled by the confluence of principles emanating from two of this Court's past decisions, each of which the Court, in its present opinion, essentially relegates to a footnote.  The first case, Morrissey v. Commissioner, 296 U.S. 344 (1935), like Hecht v. Malley, 265 U.S. 144 (1924), dealt with the tax treatment of a business trust. In holding that such an entity was not an "ordinary trust," the Court observed:
"In what are called 'business trusts' the object is not to hold and conserve particular property, with incidental powers, as in the traditional type of trusts, but to provide a medium for the conduct of a business and sharing its gains.  Thus a trust may be created as a convenient method by which persons become associated for dealings in real estate, the development of tracts of land, the construction of improvements, and the purchase, management and sale of properties; or for dealings in securities or other personal property; or for the production, or manufacture, and sale of commodities; or for commerce, or other sorts of business; where those who become beneficially interested,  either by joining in the plan at the outset, or by later participation according to the terms of the arrangement, seek to share the advantages of a union of their interests in the common enterprise." 296 U.S., at 357.
These distinctions, along with the similarities between a business trust and a corporation, led the Court to conclude that a business trust was an "association," taxable, along with corporations, joint stock companies, and insurance companies, under § 2 (a)(2) of the respective Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926, ch. 234, 43 Stat. 253, and ch. 27, 44 Stat. 9.
Concluding that Morrissey establishes that Fidelity is an unincorporated association, petitioner argues that it follows that this controversy is then controlled by the second case, Steelworkers v. Bouligny, Inc., 382 U.S. 145 (1965). In Bouligny, a unanimous Court held that an unincorporated labor union's citizenship for diversity purposes could not be determined without regard to the citizenship of its members.  Although the holding of Bouligny was limited to the diversity treatment of labor unions, the principles it enunciates are unmistakably broad.  The Court rejected the invitation of other courts and commentators to eradicate the distinction between the "citizenship" of corporations, on the one hand, and that of labor unions and other unincorporated associations, on the other hand.  See id., at 149-150. The Court stated that it was "of the view that these arguments, however appealing, are addressed to an inappropriate forum, and that pleas for extension of the diversity jurisdiction to hitherto uncovered broad categories of litigants ought to be made to the Congress and not to the courts." Id., at 150-151.
The Court of Appeals in this case recognized the pertinence of Bouligny to the problem presented here, but found that case distinguishable.  It noted that Bouligny is directly applicable only to the situation in which an unincorporated association seeks to establish diversity jurisdiction as an entity. And it adopted the view, earlier suggested in law review commentary, 6 that Bouligny did not decide who the relevant members are when a court determines the citizenship of an unincorporated association.  The Court of Appeals concluded that when an organization has more than one class of members, it is necessary to determine on a case-by-case basis which class comprises the real parties in interest.  Focusing its attention on Fidelity's Declaration of Trust, the court held that the trustees were the real parties to this lawsuit because they were designated as having exclusive control of the trust's activities, with the capacity to sue on the trust's behalf and to be sued.  See 597 F.2d 421, 427 (CA5 1979).
I believe that the approach of the Court of Appeals in this case was consistent with this Court's prior decisions.  And I much prefer it to the simplistic approach the Court now adopts.  I am particularly troubled by the Court's intimation that business trusts are to be treated differently from other functionally analogous business associations -- partnerships, limited partnerships, joint stock companies, and the like.  I fear that, at bottom, the Court's distinction between business trusts and these other enterprises hinges on the locus of title to the trust assets, see ante, at 459, and 464-466, a formalistic criterion having little to do with a realistic assessment of the respective degrees of control over the trust's activities that may be exercised by shareholders and trustees.
While I prefer and accept the Court of Appeals' approach to this case, I am persuaded, on that approach, that one cannot ignore the pervasive measure of control that Fidelity's shareholders possess over the trustees' actions taken in their behalf.  See Part I, supra. 7 That factor, in my view, is the principal distinction between the ongoing business entity at issue here and the trust relationship among certificate holders and the bondholders' committee that was at issue in Bullard v. Cisco, 290 U.S. 179 (1933), cited and relied upon by the Court, ante, at 463-464.  Though the question is not free from all doubt, in the light of these circumstances I believe that the citizenship of Fidelity   should be determined according to the citizenship of its beneficial shareholders, and that diversity jurisdiction does not exist in this case. 8 I therefore dissent from the Court's holding to the contrary.
I would vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case for consideration of respondents' claimed alternative bases for federal jurisdiction that were rejected by the District Court, but not reached by the Court of Appeals.
