Per Curiam: The Court is of the view that the standard of proof required in denaturalization cases (see Schneiderman v. United States, 320 U.S. 118; Baumgartner v. United States, 322 U.S. 665) is applicable to expatriation cases arising under ยง 401 (j) of the Nationality Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1137, as amended, and has not been satisfied in this case.  Accordingly the judgment below is reversed without reaching the constitutional questions that have been presented.
