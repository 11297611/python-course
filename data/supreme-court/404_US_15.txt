OPINION
On this appeal we postponed the question of jurisdiction pending the hearing of the case on the merits.  401 U.S. 906 (1971).
Having heard the case on its merits, we find that this Court does have jurisdiction ( Alabama Teachers v. Alabama Public School and College Authority, 393 U.S. 400 (1969)) and affirm the judgment of the District Court for the  Northern District of California.  Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483 (1969).
