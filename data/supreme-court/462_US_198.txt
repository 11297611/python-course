OPINION
JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.
Promptly after the Internal Revenue Service (IRS or Service) seized respondent's property to satisfy a tax lien, respondent filed a petition for reorganization under the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, hereinafter referred to as the "Bankruptcy Code." The issue before us is whether § 542(a) of that Code authorized the Bankruptcy Court to subject the IRS to a turnover order with respect to the seized property.
I
A
Respondent Whiting Pools, Inc., a corporation, sells, installs, and services swimming pools and related equipment and supplies.  As of January 1981, Whiting owed approximately $ 92,000 in Federal Insurance Contribution Act taxes and federal taxes withheld from its employees, but had failed to respond to assessments and demands for payment by the IRS.  As a consequence, a tax lien in that amount attached to all of Whiting's property. 1
On January 14, 1981, the Service seized Whiting's tangible personal property -- equipment, vehicles, inventory, and office supplies -- pursuant to the levy and distraint provision of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. 2 According to uncontroverted findings, the estimated liquidation value of the property seized was, at most, $ 35,000, but its estimated going-concern value in Whiting's hands was $ 162,876.  The very next day, January 15, Whiting filed a petition for reorganization, under the Bankruptcy Code's Chapter 11, 11 U. S. C. § 1101 et seq. (1976 ed., Supp. V), in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of New York.  Whiting was continued as debtor-in-possession. 3
The United States, intending to proceed with a tax sale of the property, 4 moved in the Bankruptcy Court for a declaration that the automatic stay provision of the Bankruptcy Code, § 362(a), is inapplicable to the IRS or, in the alternative, for relief from the stay.  Whiting counterclaimed for an order requiring the Service to turn the seized property over to the bankruptcy estate pursuant to § 542(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. 5 Whiting intended to use the property in its reorganized business.
B
The Bankruptcy Court determined that the IRS was bound by the automatic stay provision.  In re Whiting Pools, Inc., 10 B. R. 755 (1981). Because it found that the seized property was essential to Whiting's reorganization effort, it refused to lift the stay.  Acting under § 543(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, 6 rather than under § 542(a), the court directed the IRS to turn the property over to Whiting on the condition that Whiting provide the Service with specified protection for its interests.  10 B. R., at 760-761. 7
The United States District Court reversed, holding that a turnover order against the Service was not authorized by either § 542(a) or § 543(b)(1). 15 B. R. 270 (1981). The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in turn, reversed the District Court.  674 F.2d 144 (1982). It held that a turnover order could issue against the Service under § 542(a), and it remanded the case for reconsideration of the adequacy of the Bankruptcy Court's protection conditions.  The Court of Appeals acknowledged that its ruling was contrary to that reached by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Cross Electric Co. v. United States, 664 F.2d 1218 (1981), and noted confusion on the issue among bankruptcy and district courts.  674 F.2d, at 145, and n. 1. We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict in an important area of the law under the new Bankruptcy Code.  459 U.S. 1033 (1982).
II
By virtue of its tax lien, the Service holds a secured interest in Whiting's property.  We first examine whether § 542(a) of the Bankruptcy Code generally authorizes the turnover of a debtor's property seized by a secured creditor prior to the commencement of reorganization proceedings. Section 542(a)   requires an entity in possession of "property that the trustee may use, sell, or lease under section 363" to deliver that property to the trustee.  Subsections (b) and (c) of § 363 authorize the trustee to use, sell, or lease any "property of the estate," subject to certain conditions for the protection of creditors with an interest in the property.  Section 541(a)(1)   defines the "estate" as "comprised of all the following property, wherever located: . . . all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case." Although these statutes could be read to limit the estate to those "interests of the debtor in property" at the time of the filing of the petition, we view them as a definition of what is included in the estate, rather than as a limitation.
A
In proceedings under the reorganization provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, a troubled enterprise may be restructured to enable it to operate successfully in the future.  Until the business can be reorganized pursuant to a plan under 11 U. S. C. §§ 1121-1129 (1976 ed., Supp. V), the trustee or debtor-in-possession is authorized to manage the property of the estate and to continue the operation of the business.  See § 1108.  By permitting reorganization, Congress anticipated that the business would continue to provide jobs, to satisfy creditors' claims, and to produce a return for its owners.  H. R. Rep. No. 95-595, p. 220 (1977).  Congress presumed that the assets of the debtor would be more valuable if used in a rehabilitated business than if "sold for scrap." Ibid.  The reorganization effort would have small chance of success, however, if property essential to running the business were excluded from the estate.  See 6 J. Moore & L. King, Collier on Bankruptcy para. 3.05, p. 431 (14th ed. 1978).  Thus, to facilitate the rehabilitation of the debtor's business, all the debtor's property must be included in the reorganization estate.
This authorization extends even to property of the estate in which a creditor has a secured interest.  §§ 363(b) and (c); see H. R. Rep. No. 95-595, p. 182 (1977).  Although Congress might have safeguarded the interests of secured creditors outright by excluding from the estate any property subject to a secured interest, it chose instead to include such property in the estate and to provide secured creditors with "adequate protection" for their interests.  § 363(e), quoted in n. 7, supra. At the secured creditor's insistence, the bankruptcy court must place such limits or conditions on the trustee's power to sell, use, or lease property as are necessary to protect the creditor.  The creditor with a secured interest in property included in the estate must look to this provision for protection, rather than to the nonbankruptcy remedy of possession.
Both the congressional goal of encouraging reorganizations and Congress' choice of methods to protect secured creditors suggest that Congress intended a broad range of property to be included in the estate.
B
The statutory language reflects this view of the scope of the estate.  As noted above, § 541(a)(1) provides that the "estate is comprised of all the following property, wherever located: . . . all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case." 11 U. S. C. § 541(a)   (1) (1976 ed., Supp. V). 8 The House and Senate Reports on the Bankruptcy Code indicate that § 541(a)(1)'s scope is broad. 9 Most important, in the context of this case, § 541(a)(1)   is intended to include in the estate any property made available to the estate by other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.  See H. R. Rep. No. 95-595, p. 367 (1977).  Several of these provisions bring into the estate property in which the debtor did not have a possessory interest at the time the bankruptcy proceedings commenced. 10
Section 542(a) is such a provision. It requires an entity (other than a custodian) holding any property of the debtor that the trustee can use under § 363 to turn that property over to the trustee. 11 Given the broad scope of the reorganization estate, property of the debtor repossessed by a secured creditor falls within this rule, and therefore may be drawn into the estate.  While there are explicit limitations on the reach of § 542(a), 12 none requires that the debtor hold a possessory interest in the property at the commencement of the reorganization proceedings. 13
As does all bankruptcy law, § 542(a) modifies the procedural rights available to creditors to protect and satisfy their liens. 14 See Wright v. Union Central Life Ins. Co., 311 U.S. 273, 278-279 (1940). See generally Nowak, Turnover Following Prepetition Levy of Distraint Under Bankruptcy Code § 542, 55 Am. Bankr. L. J. 313, 332-333 (1981). In effect, § 542(a)   grants to the estate a possessory interest in certain property of the debtor that was not held by the debtor at the commencement of reorganization proceedings. 15 The Bankruptcy Code provides secured creditors various rights, including the right to adequate protection, and these rights replace the protection afforded by possession.
C
This interpretation of § 542(a) is supported by the section's legislative history. Although the legislative Reports are silent on the precise issue before us, the House and Senate hearings from which § 542(a) emerged provide guidance.  Several witnesses at those hearings noted, without contradiction,  the need for a provision authorizing the turnover of property of the debtor in the possession of secured creditors. 16 Section 542(a) first appeared in the proposed legislation shortly after these hearings.  See H. R. 6, § 542(a), 95th Cong., 1st Sess., introduced January 4, 1977.  See generally Klee, Legislative History of the New Bankruptcy Code, 54 Am. Bankr. L. J. 275, 279-281 (1980). The section remained unchanged through subsequent versions of the legislation.
Moreover, this interpretation of § 542 in the reorganization context is consistent with judicial precedent predating the Bankruptcy Code.  Under Chapter X, the reorganization chapter of the Bankruptcy Act of 1878, as amended, §§ 101-276, 52 Stat. 883 (formerly codified as 11 U. S. C. §§ 501-676), the bankruptcy court could order the turnover of collateral in the hands of a secured creditor. Reconstruction Finance Corp. v. Kaplan, 185 F.2d 791, 796 (CA1 1950); see In re Third Ave. Transit Corp., 198 F.2d 703, 706 (CA2 1952); 6A J. Moore & L. King, Collier on Bankruptcy para. 14.03, pp. 741-742 (14th ed. 1977); Murphy, Use of Collateral in Business Rehabilitations: A Suggested Redrafting of Section 7-203 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act, 63 Calif. L. Rev. 1483, 1492-1495 (1975). Nothing in the legislative history evinces a congressional intent to depart from that practice.  Any other interpretation of § 542(a) would deprive the bankruptcy estate of the assets and property essential to its rehabilitation effort and thereby would frustrate the congressional purpose behind the reorganization provisions. 17
We conclude that the reorganization estate includes property of the debtor that has been seized by a creditor prior to the filing of a petition for reorganization.
III
A
We see no reason why a different result should obtain when the IRS is the creditor.    The Service is bound by § 542(a) to the same extent as any other secured creditor. The Bankruptcy Code expressly states that the term "entity," used in § 542(a), includes a governmental   unit.  § 101 (14).  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 16.  Moreover, Congress carefully considered the effect of the new Bankruptcy Code on tax collection, see generally S. Rep. No. 95-1106 (1978) (Report of Senate Finance Committee), and decided to provide protection to tax collectors, such as the IRS, through grants of enhanced priorities for unsecured tax claims, § 507(a)(6), and by the nondischarge of tax liabilities, § 523(a)(1).  S. Rep. No. 95-989, pp. 14-15 (1978). Tax collectors also enjoy the generally applicable right under § 363(e) to adequate protection for property subject to their liens.  Nothing in the Bankruptcy Code or its legislative history indicates that Congress intended a special exception for the tax collector in the form of an exclusion from the estate of property seized to satisfy a tax lien.
B
Of course, if a tax levy or seizure transfers to the IRS ownership of the property seized, § 542(a) may not apply.  The enforcement provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U. S. C. §§ 6321-6326 (1976 ed. and Supp. V), do grant to the Service powers to enforce its tax liens that are greater than those possessed by private secured creditors under state law.  See United States v. Rodgers, 461 U.S. 677, 682-683 (1983);id., at 713, 717-718, and n. 7 (concurring in part and dissenting in part); United States v. Bess, 357 U.S. 51, 56-57 (1958). But those provisions do not transfer ownership of the property to the IRS. 18
The Service's interest in seized property is its lien on that property.  The Internal Revenue Code's levy and seizure provisions, 26 U. S. C. §§ 6331 and 6332, are special procedural   devices available to the IRS to protect and satisfy its liens, United States v. Sullivan, 333 F.2d 100, 116 (CA3 1964), and are analogous to the remedies available to private secured creditors. See Uniform Commercial Code § 9-503, 3A U. L. A. 211-212 (1981); n. 14, supra.  They are provisional remedies that do not determine the Service's rights to the seized property, but merely bring the property into the Service's legal custody.  See 4 B. Bittker,   Federal Taxation of Income, Estates and Gifts para. 111.5.5, p. 111-108 (1981).  See generally Plumb, Federal Tax Collection and Lien Problems (First Installment), 13 Tax L. Rev. 247, 272 (1958). At no point does the Service's interest in the property exceed the value of the lien.  United States v. Rodgers, 461 U.S., at 690-691; id., at 724 (concurring in part and dissenting in part); see United States v. Sullivan, 333 F.2d, at 116 ("the Commissioner acts pursuant to the collection process in the capacity of lienor as distinguished from owner").  The IRS is obligated to return to the debtor any surplus from a sale.  26 U. S. C. § 6342(b).  Ownership of the property is transferred only when the property is sold to a bona fide purchaser at a tax sale. See Bennett v. Hunter, 9 Wall. 326, 336 (1870); 26 U. S. C. § 6339(a)(2); Plumb, 13 Tax L. Rev., at 274-275. In fact, the tax sale provision itself refers to the debtor as the owner of the property after the seizure but prior to the sale. 19 Until such a sale takes place, the property remains the debtor's and thus is subject to the turnover requirement of § 542(a).
IV
When property seized prior to the filing ofa petition is drawn into the Chapter 11 reorganization estate, the Service's tax lien is not dissolved; nor is its status as a secured creditor destroyed.  The IRS, under § 363(e), remains entitled to adequate protection for its interests, to other rights enjoyed by secured creditors, and to the specific privileges accorded tax collectors.  Section 542(a) simply requires the Service to seek protection of its interest according to the congressionally established bankruptcy procedures, rather than by withholding the seized property from the debtor's efforts to reorganize.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
It is so ordered.
