PER CURIAM.
The judgment below is affirmed on the merits.  Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533. The cases are remanded for further proceedings, with respect to relief, consistent with the views stated in our opinions in Reynolds v. Sims and in the other cases relating to state legislative apportionment decided along with Reynolds, should that become necessary.
MR. JUSTICE CLARK would affirm on the merits on the grounds stated in his opinion in Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 587.
MR. JUSTICE STEWART would affirm the judgment insofar as it holds that Oklahoma's system of legislative apportionment violates   the Equal Protection Clause.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN dissents for the reasons stated in his dissenting opinion in Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 589.
