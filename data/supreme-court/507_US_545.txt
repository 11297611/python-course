OPINION
PER CURIAM.
The Court is advised that the respondent died in Washington, D. C., on March 24, 1993. The Court's order granting the writ of certiorari, see 504 U.S. 908 (1992) , therefore is vacated, and the petition for certiorari is dismissed. See   Mintzes v. Buchanon, 471 U.S. 154, 85 L. Ed. 2d 120, 105 S. Ct. 2006 (1985).
It is so ordered.
