OPINION
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.
A group of labor organizations, appellants here, and the carriers comprising the Southern Railway System, entered into a union-shop agreement pursuant to the authority of ยง 2, Eleventh of the Railway Labor Act. 1 The agreement   requires each of the appellees, employees of the carriers, as a condition of continued employment, to pay the appellant union representing his particular class or craft the dues, initiation fees and assessments uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining union membership. The appellees, in behalf of themselves and of employees similarly situated, brought this action in the Superior Court of Bibb County, Georgia, alleging that the money each was thus compelled to pay to hold his job was in substantial part used to finance the campaigns of candidates for federal and state offices whom he opposed, and to promote the propagation of political and economic doctrines, concepts and ideologies with which he disagreed.  The Superior Court found that the allegations were fully proved 2 and entered a judgment and decree enjoining the enforcement of the   unionshop agreement on the ground that ยง 2, Eleventh violates the Federal Constitution to the extent that it permits such use by the appellants of the funds exacted from employees. 3 The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed,  215 Ga. 27, 108 S. E. 2d 796. 4 On appeal to this Court under 28 U. S. C. ยง 1257 (1), we noted probable jurisdiction,  361 U.S. 807.
