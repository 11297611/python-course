Supp. 1949), Tit. 52, §§ 286.1-286.17, the constitutionality of which is drawn in question by these appeals. The causes are therefore ordered continued for such period as will enable appellants with all convenient speed to secure in an appropriate state proceeding a determination as to the effect of this repeal on the matters raised in these appeals.
Cause continued.
