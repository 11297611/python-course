PER CURIAM.
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio is reversed.  Redrup v. New York, 386 U.S. 767.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE concurs on the ground that evidence of contemporary community standards was excluded at trial.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN would affirm for the reasons set forth in his separate opinion in Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 496, 500-503, and in his dissenting opinion in Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413, 455.
