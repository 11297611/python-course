OPINION
The United States brought this action under the Veterans' Emergency Housing Act of 1946 1 to compel restitution of allegedly excessive  prices charged by respondents in the sale of two houses.  The District Court entered judgment for respondents, 89 F.Supp. 708, and the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed, 185 F.2d 608. We granted certiorari, 341 U.S. 925.
Maximum sales prices for the two houses had been stipulated by respondents in securing the permission to build required under Priorities Regulation 33. 2 Statutory authority for that regulation had been repealed before the sale of respondents' houses, except for a proviso continuing in full force and effect priorities for building materials issued under the Veterans' Emergency Housing Act of 1946. 3 The Government views the maximum prices stipulated by respondents as a condition of construction authorization and priorities assistance that survived repeal under the proviso. We reject this view.
The 1946 Act contained detailed authorization for price restrictions on houses and for priorities on building materials.  When that Act was repealed in 1947, Congress provided for veterans' preferences in the sale and rental of housing and for rent ceilings on certain accommodations  constructed with the assistance of priorities secured under the 1946 Act. 4 Congress addressed itself to the problem of veterans' housing, but refrained from imposing any price restrictions on the sale of houses.  Congress having indicated a contrary purpose, we will not impose such restrictions by implication.
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE MINTON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
