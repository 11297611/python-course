OPINION
We granted certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 442 F.2d 694 (1971), affirming the judgment of the District Court for the Southern District of New York, 315 F.Supp. 357 (1970). 404 U.S. 909 (1971). We agree that in this noncollision admiralty case the District Court properly dismissed petitioner's third-party complaint for contribution against respondent Erie on the authority of Halcyon Lines v. Haenn Ship Corp., 342 U.S. 282 (1952). The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore
Affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE POWELL took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
