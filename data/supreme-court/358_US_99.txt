PER CURIAM.
We believe that dismissal of the representation petition on the sole ground of the Board's "long standing policy not to exercise jurisdiction over the hotel industry" as a class, is contrary to the principles expressed in Office Employes v. Labor Board, 353 U.S. 313, 318-320 (1957). The judgment is therefore reversed and the case remanded to the Court of Appeals for proceedings not inconsistent herewith.
