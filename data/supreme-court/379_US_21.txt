OPINION
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.Two employees in respondent's plant, Davis and Harmon, undertook to organize the employees who worked there.  The Superintendent was advised by another employee, one Pate, that Davis and Harmon, while soliciting him for membership in the union, had told him the union would use dynamite to get in if the union did not acquire the authorizations. Respondent thereafter discharged Davis and Harmon because of these alleged statements. An unfair labor practice proceeding was brought.  The Board held that the discharges violated §§ 8 (a)(1) and 8 (a)(3) of the Act, 1 61 Stat. 136, 140-141, 29 U. S. C. §§ 158 (a)(1) and (a)(3).  It found that Pate's charges against Davis and Harmon were untrue and that they had actually made no threats against the company's property; and it concluded that respondent's honest belief in the truth of the statement was not a defense.  137 N. L. R. B. 766, 772-773.
The Court of Appeals refused reinstatement of Davis and Harmon, holding that since the employer acted in good faith, the discharges were not unlawful.   322 F.2d 57. We granted the petition for certiorari because of a conflict among the Circuits.  Cf. with the opinion below  Labor Board v. Industrial Cotton Mills, 208 F.2d 87;  Labor Board v. Cambria Clay Products Co., 215 F.2d 48;  Cusano v. Labor Board, 190 F.2d 898.
We find it unnecessary to reach the questions raised under § 8 (a)(3) for we are of the view that in the context of this record § 8 (a)(1) was plainly violated, whatever the employer's motive. 2 Section 7   grants employees,   inter alia, "the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations." Defeat of those rights by employer action does not necessarily depend on the existence of an anti-union bias. Over and again the Board has ruled that § 8 (a)(1) is violated if an employee is discharged for misconduct arising out of a protected activity, despite the employer's good faith, when it is shown that the misconduct never occurred.  See, e. g.,  Mid-Continent Petroleum Corp., 54 N. L. R. B. 912, 932-934;   Standard Oil Co., 91 N. L. R. B. 783, 790-791;  Rubin Bros. Footwear, Inc., 99 N. L. R. B. 610, 611. 3   In sum, § 8 (a)(1) is violated if it is shown that the discharged employee was at the time engaged in a protected activity, that the employer knew it was such, that the basis of the discharge was an alleged act of misconduct in the course of that activity, and that the employee was not, in fact, guilty of that misconduct. 
That rule seems to us to be in conformity with the policy behind § 8 (a)(1). Otherwise the protected activity would lose some of its immunity, since the example of employees who are discharged on false charges would or might have a deterrent effect on other employees.  Union activity often engenders strong emotions and gives rise to active rumors.  A protected activity acquires a precarious status if innocent employees can be discharged while engaging in it, even though the employer acts in good faith.  It is the tendency of those discharges to weaken or destroy the § 8 (a)(1) right that is controlling.  We are not in the realm of managerial prerogatives. Rather we are concerned with the manner of soliciting union membership over which the Board has been entrusted with powers of surveillance.  See  Garment Workers v. Labor Board, 366 U.S. 731, 738-739;  Labor Board v. Erie Resistor Corp., 373 U.S. 221, 228-229. Had the alleged dynamiting threats been wholly disassociated from § 7 activities quite different considerations might apply.
Reversed.

CONCUR BY: HARLAN (In Part)
DISSENT BY: HARLAN (In Part)
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring in part and dissenting in part.
Both the rule adopted by the lower court and that now announced by this Court seem to me unacceptable.  On the one hand, it impinges on the rights assured by §§ 7 and 8 (a)(1) to hold, as the Court of Appeals did, that the employee must bear the entire brunt of his honest, but mistaken, discharge.  On the other hand, it is hardly fair that the employer should be faced with the choice of risking damage to his business or incurring a penalty for taking honest action to thwart it.
Between these two one-way streets lies a middle two-way course: a rule which would require reinstatement of the mistakenly discharged employee and back pay only as of the time that the employer learned, or should have learned, of his mistake, subject, however, to a valid business reason for refusing reinstatement. 1 Such a rule gives offense neither to any policy of the statute nor to the dictates of fairness to the employer, and in my opinion represents a reasonable accommodation between the two inflexible points of view evinced by the opinions below and here.
Since I do not believe that this case presents the rare situation in which the Board can ignore motive, 2 I would vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the Board for further appropriate proceedings in light of what I believe to be the proper rule.
