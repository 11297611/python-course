OPINION
JUSTICE O'CONNOR delivered the opinion of the Court.
The issue in this case is whether 5 U. S. C. § 5334(b), which requires a two-step pay increase for federal employees "promoted . . . to a position in a higher grade," applies to prevailing wage rate employees promoted to General Schedule positions.  We hold that it does not apply, and reverse the judgment of the Court of Claims.
I
This case involves the relationship between the two principal pay systems for federal employees and the pay treatment to which an employee moving from one system to another is entitled.  Both systems are governed by Title 5, United States Code.
One of the pay systems, the General Schedule (GS), 5 U. S. C. § 5331 et seq. (1976 ed. and Supp.  V), applies to federal "white-collar" employees.  See R. Vaughn, Principles of Civil Service Law § 6.2(a), p. 6-4 (1976) (hereinafter Vaughn).  The GS is divided into 18 numbered grades; as the number of the grade increases, so do pay and responsibilities.  §§ 5104 and 5332 (1976 ed. and Supp. V).  The grades are subdivided into rates of pay or "steps." § 5332. The  salary for each step of each grade in the GS is uniform nationwide. 1
The second principal pay system is the prevailing rate wage system (WS), 5 U. S. C. § 5341 et seq. (1976 ed. and Supp. V), which primarily applies to those federal "blue-collar" employees specifically excluded from the GS.  See §§ 5102(b), (c)(7), 5331, and 5342(a)(2)(A); Vaughn § 6.2(b), p. 6-17.  The WS also is divided into grades and subdivided into "steps." The rate of pay for each step within each grade is based upon wage surveys of prevailing rates for comparable work in local wage areas.  § 5343 (1976 ed. and Supp. V); Office of Personnel Management, Federal Personnel Manual, Supp. 532-1, 56 (Apr. 14, 1980) (hereinafter FPM).  Pay rates for positions within the WS thus vary from one locale to another.
Salary treatment for GS employees who change their employment status and employees  shifted or hired into the GS system is governed by 5 U. S. C. § 5334 (1976 ed. and Supp. V) and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto. Under the statute, an employee's salary after promotion is determined by reference either to the "highest previous rate" rule 2 or to the "two-step increase" rule. 3
Prior to July 1973, all six respondents worked as federal civilian employees for the Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Department of the Navy.  In those positions, they were paid pursuant to the WS.  Between July 1973 and October 1974, all were promoted to positions covered by  the GS. 4 After his promotion, Libretto learned that the other respondents received a salary increase equivalent to a two-step pay increase on their appointment to the GS positions. 5 Since Libretto's increase was based upon the "highest previous rate" rule and was much smaller, he filed a claim with the Department of the Navy.  As a result, the Navy reexamined the salary treatment afforded respondents.  Concluding the salaries of all should have been determined by applying the "highest previous rate" rule, the Navy denied Libretto's claim and notified the other respondents their salaries would be reduced accordingly.
Respondents unsuccessfully pursued their administrative remedies and then filed this action in the Court of Claims under the Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C. § 1491, and the Back Pay Act of 1966, 5 U. S. C. § 5596. Respondents contended they were entitled to a two-step increase in pay pursuant to 5 U. S. C. § 5334(b) (1976 ed., Supp. V).  The Government opposed the claims on the ground that § 5334(b) applies only to promotions within the GS and not to shifts or promotions between the WS and the GS, which are governed by § 5334(a).
The Court of Claims, reasoning that respondents had been "promoted" within the meaning of 5 CFR § 531.202(h)(2) (1969), 6 determined they were entitled to a two-step increase under § 5334(b).  Accordingly, the court invalidated, as inconsistent with the statute, 5 CFR § 531.204(a) (1969), which construed § 5334(b) as limited to transfers or promotions within the GS.  220 Ct. Cl. 278, 599 F.2d 411 (1979).
After remand, the parties stipulated to the amount of respondents' recovery, and the court entered final judgment on August 8, 1980.  We granted the Government's petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Claims.  450 U.S. 993 (1981). We have jurisdiction based upon 28 U. S. C. § 1255 .
II
We look first to the language and organization of the statutes governing General Schedule pay rates and the prevailing rate wage system. If the statutory language is clear, it is ordinarily conclusive.  See Consumer Product Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102 (1980).
Section 5334 is part of subchapter III, chapter 53 of Title 5, entitled "General Schedule Pay Rates." Subsection 5334(a) describes the general conditions, including promotions, under which a GS employee is entitled to a change in basic pay.  It directs simply that the rate is "governed by regulations prescribed by the . . . ." Following that direction, the Civil Service Commission promulgated the "highest previous rate" rule. 7
In subsection 5334(b), on the other hand, Congress restricted the Commission's discretion in one limited situation:
"An employee who is promoted or transferred to a position in a higher grade is entitled to basic pay at the lowest rate of the higher grade which exceeds his existing rate of basic pay by not less than two step-increases of the grade from which he is promoted or transferred."
For purposes of subchapter III, 5 U. S. C. § 5331   assigns the word "grade" the meaning given the term by 5 U. S. C. § 5102(a)(5).  That section, in turn, defines a grade as those positions sufficiently similar to warrant their inclusion within one range of rates of basic pay "in the General Schedule." Giving § 5334(b) its plain meaning, then, when an employee is promoted to a position in a higher grade "in the General Schedule," he is entitled to pay which exceeds by two step-increases his pay in the grade "in the General Schedule" from which he was promoted.
The Wage System, on the other hand, is governed by subchapter IV of   chapter 53, Title 5.  No express statutory provision in subchapter IV defines how an employee's salary should be set when a WS employee is promoted to  a GS position.  Thus, the only applicable statutory provisions are those found in subchapter III and its accompanying regulations, which specifically limit the two-step increase to promotions within the GS.  Nothing in the statutory language indicates Congress intended to include employees promoted from WS to GS within the two-step requirement of § 5334(b).  Absent such language, the statute and the accompanying regulations reveal a congressional intent to apply the two-step increase provision of § 5334(b) only to promotions or transfers of employees already within the GS system.
III
Although the language of the statute is clear, any lingering doubt as to its proper construction may be resolved by examining the legislative history of the statute and by according due deference to the longstanding interpretation given the statute by the agencies charged with its interpretation.  See NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U.S. 267 (1974). The legislative history of § 5334(b) reinforces the apparent intent of the statutory language. The predecessor to § 5334(b) was § 802(b) of the Classification Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 954, 5 U. S. C. § 1071 et seq. (1946  ed. and Supp. IV) (1949 Act). 8 Through the 1949 Act, Congress completely revised the Classification Act of 1923, Pub. L. 516, 42 Stat. 1488, 5 U. S. C. § 661 et seq. (1925-1926 ed.). Under the latter statute, an employee who was at the top step of his grade could receive little or no salary increase upon promotion to a higher grade. That inequity resulted because the salary for the higher steps in one grade could equal or exceed the salary for the lower steps in the next higher grade. Congress' 1949 revision plainly undertook to correct this problem: the 1949 Act numbered among its stated purposes the need "to permit the solution of certain troublesome problems or to avoid unintentional pay inequities in the conduct of various personnel transactions." S. Rep. No. 847, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 4 (1949).  Congress, moreover, understood the precise nature of the salary overlap problem.  The Committee Reports which accompanied the proposed revisions explained:
"At present, a promoted employee receives no immediate increase if he is already receiving a rate in the lower grade that also occurs in the higher grade. If he is receiving a rate in the lower grade that falls between  two rates of the higher grade, he is promoted at the higher of these two rates.
"In too many cases, accordingly, an employee who is promoted to greater responsibilities or more difficult duties receives no immediate increase in pay. This is not in accord with the commonly accepted principle that a promotion in pay should  accompany a promotion in duties and responsibilities.
"Subsection (b) of section 802 corrects this situation." Id., at 38; H. R. Rep. No. 1264, 81st Cong., 1st Sess., 12-13 (1949).
Examination of the history of the prevailing wage system dispels any notion that Congress intended the corrective measure of § 802(b) to apply to movement between the prevailing wage and Classification Act systems.  In 1949, each federal agency had its own pay system for blue-collar workers.  As a result, employees holding the same federal position in the  same locale often received different wages if they worked for different agencies.  In addition,   each agency had its own job grading system for prevailing wage employees, which resulted in widely varying numbers of grades and wage steps. 9 Nothing in the legislative history suggests that Congress was even aware of -- much less was attempting to adjust -- the varied results that might occur if a prevailing wage worker moved into a Classification Act position.  The 1949 legislative history suggests only that Congress was concerned with inequities that might occur through application of the Classification Act system to movement within that system.
Moreover, in 1972, approximately one year before respondents' promotions, Congress undertook a comprehensive examination of the prevailing wage statutes and amended existing laws to declare congressional policy for the payment of prevailing wage employees.  See S. Rep. No. 92-791, p. 1  (1972).  Congress' stated purpose was to codify existing law.  Ibid.  As part of the 1972 amendments, Congress for the first time directed that a grading system be established and maintained for prevailing wage employees. 10 5 U. S. C.   § 5346 (1976 ed. and Supp. V).  Even then, Congress made no effort to correlate the WS grades with those used in the GS.  By that time, the agency practice of specifically limiting § 5334(b) and its predecessor to transfers between Classification Act, or GS, positions had been followed for nearly 25 years. 11 Congress' failure to correct that practice, if it did not correspond with congressional intent, at the very time Congress was revamping the laws applicable to pay for prevailing wage positions provides further evidence of its intent that § 802(b) and, later, § 5334(b) apply only to GS employees.  See United States v. Bergh, 352 U.S. 40 (1956).
The absence of any indication that Congress intended § 5334(b) to apply to promotions into the GS from the WS is hardly surprising, since the two systems have no necessary or obvious relationship.  First, because the WS involves an entirely separate pay structure based on prevailing rates in local wage areas, no necessary overlap occurs between WS and GS salaries. In fact, since WS rates vary by locale, an employee changing from a WS position to a GS position could receive a greater salary, a lesser salary, or the same salary as another employee making the identical change in another part of the country.  Moreover, although by definition a change to a higher grade within the GS system involves a change to a position with greater responsibility (see 5 U. S. C. § 5102(a)(5) (1976 ed., Supp. V)), no similar relationship necessarily exists between a WS grade and a GS grade. 12
Although the legislative history does not expressly indicate that Congress intended to limit § 5334(b) and its predecessor to GS employees, the history provides ample indication that such was Congress' intent.  Moreover, the reasons for enactment of the provision are consistent with such a limitation.
IV
Although not determinative, the construction of a statute by those charged with its administration is entitled to great deference, particularly when that interpretation has been followed consistently over a long period of time.  See Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., 430 U.S. 1 (1977). In this instance, the agency responsible for proposing and administering § 5334(b) has consistently construed it to apply only to promotions within the GS.
Section 802(b) of the 1949 Act was drafted and submitted to the Congress by the Civil Service Commission. 13 Soon after its enactment, the Civil Service Commission promulgated regulations interpreting the section.  The first regulations guaranteed a pay increase to one promoted "to a higher grade between Classification Act  positions. . . ." 15 Fed. Reg. 7868 (1950), 5 CFR § 25.104(a) (Supp. 1951). 14 In contrast, an employee promoted or transferred from another pay system into the Classification Act system was subject to the "highest previous rate" rule.  15 Fed. Reg. 1235 (1950), 5 CFR § 25.103(b) (Supp. 1951).  Subsequent versions of the regulations continued to apply the automatic salary increase of § 802(b) and, later, of § 5334(b), only to promotions or transfers within the Classification Act, or GS, system. 15 In fact, the regulation in effect when respondents were promoted expressly provided that the two-step pay increase provision of § 5334(b) applied "only (i) to a transfer from one General Schedule position to a higher General Schedule position, and (ii) to a promotion from one General Schedule grade to a higher General Schedule grade." 33 Fed. Reg. 12450 (1968), 5 CFR § 531.204(a)(1) (1969). 16
V
The language of the statute, the entire statutory scheme, the legislative history, and consistent administrative interpretation all demonstrate the soundness of the Government's position that § 5334(b) is inapplicable to promotions from the Wage System to the General Schedule.
The judgment of the Court of Claims is reversed.
It is so ordered.
